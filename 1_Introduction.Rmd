##Ecosystem Considerations
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis. 
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.


##Fishery Information
NEED TO FINISH 
  
The hook-and-line fishery off California developed in the late 19th century 
[@Love2002]. The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United 
States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created 
an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961].

Both gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes comprise minor parts of the Californian sport 
and commercial fisheries .  Historically, both species were taken by hook-and-line


##Summary of Management History

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) 
in 1982, GBYR were managed through a regulatory 
process that included the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along 
with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game Commission (FGC) 
depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and fishery. With implementation 
of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, GBYR came under the management 
authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC), and were managed as part 
of the *Sebastes* complex. Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment 
and did not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and 
managed as part of "Remaining Rockfish" under the larger 
heading of "Other Rockfish" (PFMC [-@PFMC2004; -@PFMC2002]).

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to 
manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally 
for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish 
fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access 
with specific regulations designed for each component. Other regulatory actions 
for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, 
and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors - limited entry 
fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl.
Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and 
commercial sectors. 

In 2000, changes in the PFMC’s rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued 
use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced with three species 
groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of which GBYR are 
included in the nearshore group. Within the nearshore group, they are included in the 
“shallow nearshore rockfish” component. 

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in the way 
that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life Management Act 
(MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California Legislature and enacted in 
1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for nearshore finfish [@Vandenberg2014]. It also gave 
authority to the FGC to regulate commercial and recreational nearshore fisheries 
through FMPs and provided broad authority to adopt regulations for the nearshore 
fishery during the time prior to adoption of the nearshore finfish FMP. Within this 
legislation, the Legislature also included commercial size limits for ten nearshore
species including GBYR (10-inch minimum size) and a requirement 
that commercial fishermen landing these ten nearshore species possess a nearshore permit.

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by the FGC in 
fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002 which established a set 
of marine reserves around the Channel Islands in southern California (which became 
effective April 2003).  The FGC also adopted a nearshore restricted access program in December 
2002 (which included the establishment of a Deeper Nearshore Permit) to be effective 
starting in the 2003 fishing year.

Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the Council and State in a coordinated 
effort developed and adopted various management specifications to keep harvest 
within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures (e.g. the CCAs; 
a closure of Cordell Banks to specific fishing), depth restrictions, minimum 
size limits, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license 
and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal 
and area closures (e.g. the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to 
specific fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size 
limits to regulate the commercial fishery.

The state of California has adopts regulatory measures to manage the fishery 
based on the harvest guidelines set forth by the PFMC.  The commercial open access 
and limited entry fixed gear sectors have undergone 
three different spatial management changes in since 2000.  Since 2005, both 
have managed the area south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude as one area. 
he open access commercial fishery is managed based on bimonthly 
allowable catches, that have ranged from 200 pounds to 1800 pounds per two months since 2000.  
From 2005 to 2018, the catch limits have doubled and are now set at 1200 pounds per two 
months (for all months) with March and April remaining closed. The limited entry fixed year 
sector has followed the same pattern as the open access sector with bi-monthly limits 
and a doubling of the catch since 2005. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed on 
monthly limits on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300 pounds per month for 
non-IFQ species.  A history of California's commercial regulations from 2000-2018 can be 
found in Appendix X.

Significant regulatory changed in California's recreational sector began with a change 
from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed in 1999 and prior to no more than 
three hooks and one line per angler in 2000.  Since 2001, the limit has been no more than 
two hooks and one line per angler.  There is no size limit in the recreational fishery 
for gopher or black-and-yellow rockfish.  GBYR are part of the nearshore complex which has 
had a sub-bag limit within the rockfish bag limit since 1999.  The nearshore sub-bag limit 
has been 10 fish since 2005.  

California also began spatial management, closures, and depth restrictions for the recreational 
fleet in 2000.  In general, the recreational season north of Pt. Conception extends from April to 
December, and south of Pt. Conception from March to December.  In the area that GBYR are most 
commonly landed, from Monterey to Morro Bay, the depth restrictions have been between 30 and 40 
fathoms until 2017.  In 2017 the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms, opening up fishing 
depths along the central California coast that had not been open consistently since 2002.  In 
both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms was closed prior to the season in December due to high 
by-catch rates of yelloweye rockfish, one of two rockfish species that are still overfished. A 
full history of the recrational regulations relating to teh spatial management of the fleet can 
be found in Appendix XXX.


##Management Performance
NEED TO FINISH  
The contribution of GBYR to the minor nearshore rockfish OFLs is currently derived from 
two sources: 1) forecasts from Key et al. [-@Key2005], from Cape Mendocino to 
Pt. Conception and 2) a Depletion Corrected Average Catch (DCAC [@MacCall2009]) for the 
area south of Point Conception. Estimated catch  of GBYR has been...... A summary of these values 
as well as other base case summary results can be found in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}.



##Fisheries Off Mexico or Canada
The range of GBYR does not extend north to the Canadian border, and they are rarely 
encountered in Oregon and Washington.  The southern end of the gopher rockfish's range 
extends to Punta San Roque (southern Baja California) whiel the southern end of the 
black-and-yellow rockfish's range extends to Isla Natividad (central Baja California) 
[@Love2002].  This was no available information on the fishery for GBYR at the time 
of this assessment, nor additional details on the abundance or distribution patterns 
in Mexican waters.
