##Ecosystem Considerations
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis. 
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.


##Fishery Information
The hook-and-line fishery off California developed in the late 19th century 
[@Love2002]. The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United 
States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created 
an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961].

Both gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes comprise minor parts of the Californian sport 
and commercial fisheries [@Love1987].  Historically, both species were taken by hook-and-line


##Summary of Management History
GBYR are federally designated groundfish and 
part of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and are managed by the Pacific Fishery 
Management Council (PFMC). Thus, federal commercial regulations that apply to 
the \emph{Sebastes} complex apply to gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish. Additionally, 
the State of California regulates the species for both the commercial and recreational 
sectors by means of the State Legislature, the Fish and Game Commission (FGC), and the 
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). Because GBY rockfish are members of 
the \emph{Sebastes} complex, the PFMC has actively managed them under the general umbrella 
of regulatory measures that applied to the \emph{Sebastes} complex until 2000 (PFMC 2002). 
In 2000, changes in the PFMC’s rockfish management structure resulted in the discontinued 
use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex and minor rockfishes, and were replaced with three species 
groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes (January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of which GBYR are 
included in the nearshore group. Within the nearshore group, they are included in the 
“shallow nearshore rockfish” component. Additionally, north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N latitude. 
latitude (near Cape Mendocino) gopher rockfish are included in the “other nearshore rockfish” 
group. However, since GBYR are rarely taken in this area of California they essentially 
do not contribute to the northern California catch.
 
Since the early 1980s a variety of federal regulatory measures have been used to manage the 
rockfishes, including cumulative trip limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons 
for the commercial sector. Over the years these cumulative trip limits have steadily decreased. 
Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two components: 
limited entry and open access with specific regulations designed for each component. Other 
regulatory actions for the general rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, 
and cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial sectors - limited entry 
fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl.
Harvest guidelines are also used to regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and 
commercial sectors. In 2002, allocation harvest guidelines for the shallow nearshore rockfish 
group were set for the recreational and commercial sectors south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude at 
532 and 124 metric tons, respectively. By contrast, the 2003 recreational and commercial harvest 
guidelines were set at 433 and 108 metric tons, respectively. In 2004, the harvest guidelines 
were set at 375 and 97 metric tons for the recreational and commercial sectors, respectively. 
A history of the commercial regulations can be found in Appendix XX.
 
The state of California has also adopted various regulatory measures to manage the fishery over 
the years. Notably, regulations affecting the recreational sector include changes in bag limits 
starting in 2000, area and seasonal closures, depth restrictions, the creation of the Rockfish 
and Lingcod management areas in 2000, and the creation of the Cowcod Conservation Area (CCA) in 
2001. In 1998, the Marine Life Management Act (MLMA) was enacted, which paved the way for the 
development of the Nearshore Fishery Management Plan (CDFG 2001). More recent regulatory actions 
included the FGC adopting marine reserves for the Channel Islands (became effective January 1, 2003) 
which closed areas to fishing, and in 2004 additional regulatory measures were adopted to change bag 
limits, boat limits, closure of the Cordell Bank, and in the CCA fishing was restricted to depths 
shoreward of 20 fathoms.

Commercial fishery management was enacted primarily through statues adopted by the state Legislature, 
until the passage of the MLMA in 1998. The MLMA transferred authority to the FGC to regulate the 
nearshore finfish fishery, including gopher rockfish (CDFG 2001). State commercial regulations 
include: license and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, a nearshore fishery permit moratorium 
(2001), the implementation of a nearshore fishery permit restricted access program (2003), gear
restrictions, area and season and time closures, regulations pertaining to Marine Protected Areas 
and Commercial Management areas, depth restrictions, and a minimum total length size limit of 
10 inches (254 mm) in 1999.
