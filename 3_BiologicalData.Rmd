###Biological Parameters and Data

Neither gophr nor black-and-yellow rockfish have forked tails, therefore total 
legnth and fork length are equal.  All of the data provided for this assessment 
were either in fork length or total length.

**Length and Age Compositions**

Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item CALCOM (\emph{commercial retained dead fish}, 1987, 1992-2018)   
  \item WCGOP (\emph{commercial discarded fish}, 2004-2018)    
  \item Deb Wilson-Vandenber's onboard observer survey (\emph{recreational charter retained and discarded catch}, 1987-1998)
  \item California recreational sources combined (\emph{recreational charter retained catch})     
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
      \item Miller and Gotshall dockside survey (1959-1966)    
      \item Ally  et al. onboard observer survey (1985-1987)
      \item Collins and Crooke onboard observer survey (1975-1978)     
      \item MRFSS dockside survey (1980-2003)     
      \item CRFS onboard and dockside survey (2004-2018)
    \end{itemize}
 \item PISCO dive survey (\emph{research}, 2001-2018)      
 \item CCFRP hook-and-line survey (\emph{research}, 2007-2018)        
\end{itemize}

The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}.  Descriptions and details of the length
composition data are in the above section for each fleet or survey.

**Age Structures**

A total of 2,467 otoliths were incorporated in this assessment and a 
summary by source can be found in Table \ref{tab:Age_data}.  Gopher rockfish 
comprised 80% of the samples (946 females, 901 males, 121 unknown sex), 
and all but a few black-and-yellow rockfish (247 females, 232 males, 20 
unknown sex) came from a directed study by Jody Zaitlin [-@Zaitlin1986] 
(Figure \ref{fig:growth_samples}).

Of the available ages, 91% were collected during fishery-independent surveys.  
An additional 36 otoliths were collected by Cal Poly during their CPFV 
onboard observer survey in 2018. The remaining 7.5% were from commercial 
port samples or recreational dockside surveys.
Black-and-yellows represent 20% of the samples collected, and are mainly derived from 
Ralph Larson's work in Monterey Bay. 

All otoliths were read by Don Pearson (NMFS SWFSC, now retired) and ages ranged 
from 1-28. The aged black-and-yellow rockfish 
ranged in length from 7-32 cm with a mean of 24 cm and gopher rockfish ranged in length 
from 11-36 cm, with a mean of 26.  In terms of ages, the black-and-yellow rockfish ranged 
from 2-19 and gophers from 2-28.  Fits to the von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonB1938], $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in 
years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ 
is the asymptotic length, were explore by species and sex. 
 

No significant differences were found in growth between males and females,
or between gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes.

**Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity**
Gopher Females mature at 20.7 cm and live to 24 years old. Mature females in Central California release larvae between January and July [@Love et. al. 2002].

Black-and-yellow Females mature at 17 cm producing 25,000 - 450,000 eggs spawning from January to May. One brood is released per season for both black and yellow and gopher rockfish [@Love et. al. 2002]. 


Females reach 50% maturity at 17.5 cm or 4 years of age in Central California and were 100% mature by age 6, with the same age of maturity found in southern California though individuals were smaller at age (Zaitlin 1986).

###Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the Assessment
In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations were explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.
