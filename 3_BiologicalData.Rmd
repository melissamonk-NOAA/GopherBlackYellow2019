###Biological Parameters and Data

Neither gopher nor black-and-yellow rockfish have forked tails, therefore total 
length and fork length are equal.  All of the data provided for this assessment 
were either in fork length or total length.

**Age Structures**

A total of 2,421 otoliths were incorporated in this assessment and a 
summary by source can be found in Table \ref{tab:Age_data}. The final 
base model excludes the commercial age data that were sparse and not 
representative of the fishery.  Gopher rockfish 
comprised 79% of the samples (922 females, 879 males, 121 unknown sex), 
and all but a few black-and-yellow rockfish (247 females, 232 males, 20 
unknown sex) came from a directed study by Jody Zaitlin [-@Zaitlin1986], 
collected from 1983-1986 (Figure \ref{fig:Age_length_by_study}).

Of the available ages, 94% were collected during fishery-independent surveys.  
The remaining 6% were recreational dockside surveys and collected by Cal Poly 
during their CPFV onboard observer survey (36 otoliths) in 2018.

All otoliths were read by Don Pearson (NMFS SWFSC, now retired) and estimated ages ranged 
from 1-28. The aged black-and-yellow rockfish 
ranged in length from 7-32 cm with a mean of 24 cm and gopher rockfish ranged in length 
from 11-36 cm, with a mean of 26.  In terms of ages, the black-and-yellow rockfish ranged 
from 2-19 and gophers from 2-28.  Fits to the von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonB1938], 
$L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in 
years, $k$ is rate of increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ 
is the asymptotic length, were explore by species and sex. 

No significant differences were found in growth between gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes (Figure \ref{Growth_by_species}) or between males and females
(Figure \ref{Growth_by_sex}), species combined.

**Aging Precision and Bias**

Uncertainty in ageing error was estimated using a collection of 376 gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish otoliths with two age reads (Figure \ref{fig:GBY_age_error}). 
Age-composition data used in the model were from a number of sources described above.  All 
otoliths were read by Don Pearson (NMFS SWFSC, no retired) who also conducted all
blind double reads. 

Ageing error was estimated using publicly available software [@Thorson2012].
The software setting for bias was set to unbiased since the same reader conducted 
the first and second readings.  The best fit model chose by AIC for the standard deviation 
was a constant coefficient of variation for reader one ad mirrored for reader two 
 (Figure \ref{fig:GBY_age_error2}).  

The resulting estimate indicated a standard deviation in age readings 
increasing from 0.74 years at age 0 to a standard deviation of 2.07 years at age 28, 
the first year of the plus group in the assessment model.

**Weight-Length**

The weight-length relationship is based on the standard power function: 
$W = \alpha(L^\beta)$ where $W$ is individual weight (kg), $L$ is length (cm), 
and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coefficients used as constants.

The weight-length relationships was estimated from the three studies, Loury [-@Loury2011],
Meyers-Cherry [-@MeyersCherry2014] (both gopher rockfish only from CCFRP) and Zaitlin 
[@Zaitlin1986] (black-and-yellow rockfish only).  Only one weight-length relationship 
was estimated for the GBYR complex. The estimated parameters are $\alpha = 8.84e^{-006}$ 
and $\beta = 3.25584$.  The estimated relationship is similar to that estimated by Lea 
et al. [-@Lea1999] for gopher rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:GBY_weight_length}). The 
weight-length relationship estimated here was used in the assessment model to 
best represent the GBYR complex.

**Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity**

The sex ratio for GBYR is assumed to be 50:50 as there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.

Zaitlin [-@Zaitlin1986] found that females reached 50% maturity at 17.5 cm or 4 years of 
age in Central California and were 100% mature by age 6, with the same age of maturity 
found in southern California though individuals were smaller at age. However, all ages from this 
study were surface ages and were re-read for this assessment. Echeverria 
[-@Echeverria1987] estimated maturity for 17 rockfish species in central California.
She found the size at first maturity and the size at 50% maturity for male and female 
gopher rockfish to be 17 cm total length, and 100% mature by 21 cm.  Black-and-yellow 
rockfish males and females were first mature at 14 cm, 50% of females were mature at 
15 cm, 50% of males mature at 16 cm.  Male black-and-yellow rockfish were 100% mature 
at 20 cm and females at 19 cm. In southern California waters, both males and females 
were found to reach first maturity at 13 cm total length [@Larson1980]. We did not have 
any samples from southern California to re-analyze the maturity ogive for that portion of 
the population.

The maturity data from Zaitlin [-@Zaitlin1986] (422 black-and-yellow rockfish) were 
re-analyzed along with samples from Meyers-Cherry [-@MeyersCherry2014] (115 gopher rockfish). 
Combining the two data sets provided an updated maturity ogive for the GBYR complex females 
(Figure \ref{fig:GBY_maturity_ogive}).  The first observed mature fish was 19 cm and the 
length at 50% was 21.66 cm, larger than suggested from the estimate used by Key et 
al. [-@Key2005] in the 2005 assessment. 
After re-analyzing the available data, the length at which 50% of 
female gopher rockfish were mature was estimated at 23.33 cm, and was 21.26 cm for female
black-and-yellow rockfish.  An important note is that the smaller fish from these studies 
were black-and-yellow rockfish and the larger fish were gopher rockfish.  Although not used in this assessment, 
the estimate of 50% maturity for 23 GBYR from these studies was 21.88 cm. The age at 50% 
mature increased in this assessment to 21.66 cm, which is 3.96 cm larger than the value 
used in the 2005 assessment.

Mature females in central California release larvae between January and July, peaking 
in February, March, and May [@Love2002;@Larson1980;@Lea1999]. Both species of GBYR release 
one brood per season [@Love2002]. Black-and-yellow rockfish females can produce 25,000 - 
450,000 eggs spawning from January to May. Gopher rockfish females ranging between 176 
and 307 grams carry approximately 249 eggs per gram of body weight 
[@MacGregor1970]. The fecundity estimates used in this assessment were provided by 
E.J. Dick (NMFS SWFSC) from a meta-analysis of fecundity in the genus \emph{Sebastes} 
[@Dick2017].

**Natural Mortality**

Hamel [-@Hamel2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches to 
relating the natural mortality rate $M$ to other life-history parameters such as 
longevity, size, growth rate and reproductive effort, to provide a prior on M. In 
that same issue of ICESJMS, Then et al. [-@Then2015], provided an updated data set 
of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish 
species, from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They 
concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an 
updated Hoenig non-linear least squares (nls) estimator $M= 4.899*{A_{max}}^{-.916}$. 
The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already 
being used for west coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative 
model forms relating $-.916M$ to $A_{max}$, Then et al. [-@Then2015] did not 
consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would 
expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error 
associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{max}$. Therefore, it would 
be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done.
Revaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@Then2015] by fitting the one-parameter 
$A_{max}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be 
-1 in the transformed space (as in Hamel [-@Hamel2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:
\begin{equation}
M = \frac{5.4}{A_{max}}
\end{equation}
 
The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal with 
mean $ln\frac{5.4}{A_{max}}$  and SE = 0.4384343 (Owen Hamel, personal communication, NMFS). 
Using a maximum age of 28 the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.193, 
which is used as a prior for in the assessment model.

###Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the Assessment
In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations were explicitly 
included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results 
of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative 
information for the assessment.
