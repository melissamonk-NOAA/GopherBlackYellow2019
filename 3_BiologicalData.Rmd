###Biological Parameters and Data



**Length and Age Compositions**

Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item Source 1 (\emph{type, e.g., commercial dead fish, research, recreational}, yyyy-yyyy)    
  \item Source 2 (\emph{type}, yyyy-yyyy)    
  \item Source 3 (\emph{research}, yyyy, yyyy, yyyy, yyyy) 
\end{itemize}


The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet is in Figure
\ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}.  Descriptions and details of the length
composition data are in the above section for each fleet or survey.

**Age Structures**


von Bertalanffy growth curve [@vonB1938], $L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}$, 
where $L_i$ is the length (cm) at age $i$, $t$ is age in years, $k$ is rate of 
increase in growth, $t_0$ is the intercept, and $L_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic length.

###Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the Assessment
In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations were explicitly included in the analysis.  This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.
