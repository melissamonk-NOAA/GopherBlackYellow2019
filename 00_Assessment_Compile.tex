off the coast of \ldots{} using data through 2018.

\subsection*{Catches}\label{catches}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Catches}

Information on historical landings of GBYR are available back to
xxxx\ldots{} (Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}). Commercial landings were
small during the years of World War II, ranging between 4 to 28 metric
tons (mt) per year.

(Figures \ref{fig:Exec_catch1}-\ref{fig:Exec_catch2})\\
(Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catches})

Since 2000, annual total landings of GBYR have ranged between 70-168 mt,
with landings in 2018 totaling 91 mt.

\subsection*{Data and Assessment}\label{data-and-assessment}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and Assessment}

This a new full assessment for GBYR, which was last assessed in \ldots{}
using Stock Synthesis Version xx. This assessment uses the newest
version of Stock Synthesis (3.30.xx). The model begins in 1916, and
assumes the stock was at an unfished equilibrium that year.

(Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}).

\subsection*{Stock Biomass}\label{stock-biomass}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Stock Biomass}

(Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} and Table
\ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}).

The 2018 estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium
spawning biomass is above the target of 40\% of unfished spawning
biomass at 4 520\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 2 340\% - 6 700\%)
(Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). Approximate confidence intervals
based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in
the estimated spawning biomass is high.

\subsection*{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Ecosystem Considerations}

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly
included in the analysis.\\
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses
(conducted elsewhere) that could contribute ecosystem-related
quantitative information for the assessment.

\subsection*{Reference Points}\label{reference-points}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reference Points}

This stock assessment estimates that GBYR in the model is above the
biomass target (\(SB_{40\%}\)), and well above the minimum stock size
threshold (\(SB_{25\%}\)). The estimated relative depletion level for
the base model in 2019 is 4 520\% (95\% asymptotic interval: \(\pm\) 2
340\% - 6 700\%, corresponding to an unfished spawning biomass of 626
million eggs (95\% asymptotic interval: 332 - 919 million eggs) of
spawning biomass in the base model (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}).
Unfished age 1+ biomass was estimated to be 2,206 mt in the base case
model. The target spawning biomass (\(SB_{40\%}\)) is 554 million eggs,
which corresponds with an equilibrium yield of 181 mt. Equilibrium yield
at the proxy \(F_{MSY}\) harvest rate corresponding to \(SPR_{50\%}\) is
169 mt (Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all}).

\subsection{Basic Information and Life
History}\label{basic-information-and-life-history}

\emph{Population Structure and Complex Assessment Considerations}

There have been a number of analyses of the genetic differentiation
between gopher rockfish and black-and-yellow rockfish that have yielded
some range of results, but have generally concluded that there is
unusually low genetic differentiation between the two species. The most
frequently used measure of genetic analyses to evaluate evidence for
population differentiation is the fixation index (\(F_{ST}\)), defined
as the proportion of the total genetic variation in one subpopulation
(subscript S) relative to the total genetic variation (subscript T)
(Waples et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Waples2008}{2008}, Hauser and
Carvalho (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hauser2008}{2008})). Values of
\(F_{ST}\) range from 0 to 1 where a zero value implies the populations
are panmictic and a value closer to one implies the two populations are
genetically independent. Values of \(F_{ST}\) thought to be consistent
with biologically meaningful genetic differentiation and demographic
isolation between populations range from 0.05 to 0.1 (Waples and
Gaggiotti \protect\hyperlink{ref-Waples2006}{2006}). It is also
important to note that \(F_{ST}\) values are dependent on the study's
sample size and it may not necessarily be appropriate to compare them
across studies.

Morphologically, gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes are almost
indistinct, except for their color variation (Hubbs and Schultz
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hubbs1933}{1933}). Early efforts to evaluate
whether the two species were genetically distinct began with an allozyme
analysis by Seeb et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Seeb1986}{1986}), which
did not detect genetic differentiation between gopher and
black-and-yellow rockfish. However, as allozymes are proteins that are
often conserved due against variation, this early work was not
enormously conclusive. In a subsequent study of restriction site
polymorphisms, Hunter et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hunter1994}{1994})
found slight but significant differences between species based on
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's). Following that
study, an analysis of the mitochondrial control region by Alesandri and
Bernardi (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Alesandrini1999}{1999}) did not detect
differences between the two species, although there were limitations
regarding how representative those results were across the genome.
Analysis of seven microsatellite loci by Narum et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Narum2004}{2004}) found an \(F_{ST}\) of 0.049
across the overlapping range of the two species, which provided some
evidence of divergence, although such divergence is relatively low
compared to other species within *Sebastes. Those authors characterized
their results as suggesting that the two are ``reproductively isolated
incipient species.''\\
Buonaccorsi et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Buonaccorsi2011}{2011}) found
an even lower \(F_{ST}\) of 0.01 using 25 loci, and concluded that
gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish ``have not completed the speciation
process.'' All of these studies are indicative of low levels of genetic
divergence and a high probability of ongoing gene flow between the two
nominal species.

Most recently, an analysis of microhaplotypes by Baetscher
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baetscher2019}{2019}) observed a higher
frequency of mis-assignments of individuals to between gopher and
black-and-yellow rockfishes compared to all other pairs of species in
the genus \emph{Sebastes}. In addition, comparisons of \(F_{ST}\) values
within the study indicated that the level of genetic differentiation
observed between gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes is less than
that observed among all other pairwise comparisons of the 54 species in
the \emph{Sebastes} genus that were included in their analysis.
Baetscher (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baetscher2019}{2019}) characterized
the results as suggestive of the two species representing ``sister
species with evidence of ongoing gene flow,'' noting that a more
rigorous evaluation of the level of genetic distinction between these
two species would benefit from whole-genome sequencing of
representatives from each species group.

In addition to the differnces in coloration, the depth distribution and
range differ between the two species. The range of both species extends
from Cape Blanco Oregon to Baja California, though they are uncommon
north of Fort Bragg, California and black-and-yellow rockfish is
uncommon south of Point Conception, California. Gopher rockfish are
found in rocky reef habitat from the intertidal to depths of 264 ft (80
m) with a predominant depth distribution of 30 to 120 ft (9-37 m), while
the black-and-yellow rockfish occupies depths from the intertidal to 120
ft (40 m) and is predominantly observed in depths shallower than 60 ft
(18 m) (Eschmeyer et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Eschmeyer1983}{1983},
Love et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}).

Both species are solitary, sedentary, territorial species with home
ranges of 10-12 square meters, with occasional extended trips (Love et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}). A large percentage (6-71\%)
of black-and-yellow rockfish retuend to the site of capture within two
weeks after tranlocated within 50 m (Hallacher
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hallacher1984}{1984}). Lea et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lea1999}{1999}) found that gopher rockfish
exhibit minor patterns of movement (\textless{}1.5 nm, 2.8 km) with all
fish being recaptured on the same reef system where they were tagged.
Another study, conducted by (Matthews
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Matthews1985}{1985}), reported movements up to
1.2 km by gopher rockfish that traveled from a low-relief natural reef
to a high-relief artificial reef. The change in substrate type may have
been a factor in the movement in the
Matthews(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Matthews1985}{1985}) study.

Larson (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Larson1980}{1980}) conducted a study on
the territoriality and segregation between gopher and black-and-yellow
rockfishes. When one species was removed, the other extended its depth
range to areas where the other previously occupied, indicating
interspecifci competition plays a role in controlling their depth
distributions where both species are present. Of the two species,
black-and-yellow rockfish are socially dominant and agressive towards
excluding gopher rockfish from shallower waters.

Both species are be feed at night, with similar diets composed primarily
of crabs and shrimp,supplemented by fish and cephalopods (Love et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}, Hallacher and Roberts
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hallacher1985}{1985}), Larson
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Larson1972}{1972})). Loury et al. (Loury et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Loury2015}{2015}) found no significant differnces
in the diet of gopher rockfish inside and outside the 35 year old Point
Lobos Marine Protected Area (MPA). She did find the diet of gopher
rockfish at Ano Nuevo (shallower and north of Point Lobos) dominated by
crabs and dominated by brittle stars at southern, deeper study
locations. Zuercher (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zuercher2019}{2019})
examined the diets of a suite of nearshore rockfish species including
black-and-yellow and found that they relied on hard-bodied benthic
invertebrates such as Brachyuran crabs, shrimps, other anthropods, and
octopus. The diet of black-and-yellow rockfish remained the same across
sampling years, but they occupied a lower trophic level during the
upwelling season.

\subsection{Early Life History}\label{early-life-history}

Both gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish are viviparous and release one
brood per season between January and July (Echeverria
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Echeverria1987}{1987}). Larvae are approximately
4 mm in length and have a 1-2 month pelagic stage before recruiting to
the kelp forest canopy, i.e., surface fronds of
\emph{Macrosystis pyrifera} and \emph{Cysteoseira osmundacea} at around
15-21 mm (Anderson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Anderson1983}{1983}, Wilson et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wilson2008}{2008})). The larvae are
transparent until they reach juvenile stage at 22-23 mm. Differences in
coloration begin to occur at 25-30 mm and can be used to identify one
species from the other. Gopher rockfish become more orange and brown,
while black-and-yellow rockfish become more black and yellow. Benthic
juveniles associate with \emph{Macrosystis} holdfasts and sporophylls
(Anderson \protect\hyperlink{ref-Anderson1983}{1983}). Gopher and
black-and-yellow rockfish have similar development

The juveniles undergo ontogenetic migration down the stalks to deeper
depths, finally settling on rocky reef habitat in their respective adult
depth distribution. Juvenile bocaccio and other fish predate on young of
year and other reef dwelling species including Cabezon predate on
post-settlement juveniles. Individuals avoid rough surge conditions and
predators by hiding in the rocky bottom during the daylight hours, then
returning to more open water at dusk (Love et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}).

\subsection{Ecosystem Considerations}\label{ecosystem-considerations-1}

In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly
included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a lack of relevant
data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that could contribute
ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

\subsection{Fishery Information}\label{fishery-information}

NEED TO FINISH

The hook-and-line fishery off California developed in the late 19th
century (Love et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}). The
rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the
United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of
red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein (Harry
and Morgan \protect\hyperlink{ref-Harry1961}{1961}, Alverson et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Alverson1964}{1964}).

Gopher and black-and-yellow (referred to from hereon as GBRY when
discussing the complex) rockfish have been a minor component of the
commercial and recreational rockfish fishery since at least the late
1960s (CFIS and RecFIN). The commercial catch histories of the two
species cannot easily be separated (Figure
\ref{fig:Catches_livedeadNS}). From 1916-1936 only black-and-yellow
rockfish were reported in the landings, and an average of 0.04 mt of
black-and-yellow rockfish are reported from 1937-1983. Black-and-yellow
rockfish reappear in the landings in 1984 with 7.2 mt landed
commercially. From 1985-1988 the trend switches and only
black-and-yellow rockfish appear in the commercial landings, with gopher
rockfish averaging 0.1 mt landed, and 0 mt reported in 1987. From 1988
and on, the landings are dominated by gopher rockfish, and both species
are represented in the commercial landings.

The landings from south of Pt. Conception are minor throughout the time
period, with peaks in the 1950s and 60s for gopher rockfish.
Black-and-yellow rockfish are rare south of Pt. Conception and expected
that these catches are minimal.

The live fish fishery began in the early 1990s, with the first
commercial landings of live gopher rockfish in 1993, and
black-and-yellow rockfish a year later. By 1995 over half (57\%; 39 mt)
of the commercial landings were from the live fish fishery. This
increased quickly over the next few years and has been on average 84\%
of the landed GBYR since 2000. The majority of the landings are from
gopher rockfish north of Pt. Conception. Landings of live GBYR south of
Pt. Conception wer higher in the late 1990s, (max. 3.2 mt in 1999), and
have been averaging 0.4 mt since 2003.

The recreational GBYR fishery for California ports north of Point
Conception peaked during a five-year period in the early 1990s, with
2001 and 2003 also being productive years (Figure 2). Since 1983,
anglers caught the greatest proportion of gopher rockfish from private
and rental boats (71\%), followed next by party and charter boats
(27\%). However, in more recent years (1997 to 2004) these proportions
have changed, with the private and rental boats taking 59\% of gopher
rockfish in the recreational fishery and 41\% by the party and charter
boats. Also since 1983, gopher rockfish have ranked 25th in northern
California recreational fishery landings, accounting for approximately
1\% of the total harvest for all recreationally caught fishes. However,
gopher rockfish made up approximately 50\% of the estimated take of the
shallow nearshore rockfishes and 6\% of all nearshore rockfish species
combined. Add in revenue here. Additionally, recent catches have been
influenced by size and bag limits.

Starting in the late 1980s (Larson and Wilson-Vandenberg 2001) the
premium quality live- fish market developed. Currently, nearly all
gopher rockfish are landed in this condition due to a more lucrative
high-demand market. As a result of the increasing demand for live- fish
the average price per pound has risen steadily from a low of less than
\$2.00 per pound at the inception of the live- fish market to
approximately \$6.15 (preliminary) per pound in 2004 (CFIS- CMASTR)
(unadjusted for inflation).

\subsection{Summary of Management
History}\label{summary-of-management-history}

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) in 1982, GBYR were managed through a regulatory process that
included the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) along
with either the California State Legislature or the Fish and Game
Commission (FGC) depending on the sector (recreation or commercial) and
fishery. With implementation of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, GBYR
came under the management authority of the Pacific Fishery Management
Council (PFMC), and were managed as part of the \emph{Sebastes} complex.
Because neither species had undergone rigorous stock assessment and did
not compose a large fraction of the landings they were classified and
managed as part of ``Remaining Rockfish'' under the larger heading of
``Other Rockfish'' (PFMC (\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2002}{2002},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PFMC2004}{2004})).

Since the early 1980s a number of federal regulatory measures have been
used to manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip
limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994
the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two
components: limited entry and open access with specific regulations
designed for each component. Other regulatory actions for the general
rockfish categories have included area closures, gear restrictions, and
cumulative bimonthly trip limits set for the four different commercial
sectors - limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access
trawl, and open access non-trawl. Harvest guidelines are also used to
regulate the annual harvest for both the recreational and commercial
sectors.

In 2000, changes in the PFMC's rockfish management structure resulted in
the discontinued use of the \emph{Sebastes} complex, and was replaced
with three species groups: nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfishes
(January 4, 2000; 65 FR 221), of which GBYR are included in the
nearshore group. Within the nearshore group, they are included in the
``shallow nearshore rockfish'' component.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in
the way that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life
Management Act (MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California
Legislature and enacted in 1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for
nearshore finfish (Wilson-Vandenberg et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Vandenberg2014}{2014}). It also gave authority to
the FGC to regulate commercial and recreational nearshore fisheries
through FMPs and provided broad authority to adopt regulations for the
nearshore fishery during the time prior to adoption of the nearshore
finfish FMP. Within this legislation, the Legislature also included
commercial size limits for ten nearshore species including GBYR (10-inch
minimum size) and a requirement that commercial fishermen landing these
ten nearshore species possess a nearshore permit.

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by
the FGC in fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002
which established a set of marine reserves around the Channel Islands in
southern California (which became effective April 2003). The FGC also
adopted a nearshore restricted access program in December 2002 (which
included the establishment of a Deeper Nearshore Permit) to be effective
starting in the 2003 fishing year.

Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the Council and State in a
coordinated effort developed and adopted various management
specifications to keep harvest within the harvest targets, including
seasonal and area closures (e.g.~the CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to
specific fishing), depth restrictions, minimum size limits, and bag
limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license and permit
regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal and area
closures (e.g.~the RCAs and CCAs; a closure of Cordell Banks to specific
fishing), depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size limits to
regulate the commercial fishery.

The state of California has adopts regulatory measures to manage the
fishery based on the harvest guidelines set forth by the PFMC. The
commercial open access and limited entry fixed gear sectors have
undergone three different spatial management changes in since 2000.
Since 2005, both have managed the area south of \(40^\circ 10^\prime\)
N. latitude as one area. he open access commercial fishery is managed
based on bimonthly allowable catches, that have ranged from 200 pounds
to 1800 pounds per two months since 2000.\\
From 2005 to 2018, the catch limits have doubled and are now set at 1200
pounds per two months (for all months) with March and April remaining
closed. The limited entry fixed year sector has followed the same
pattern as the open access sector with bi-monthly limits and a doubling
of the catch since 2005. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed on
monthly limits on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300
pounds per month for non-IFQ species. A history of California's
commercial regulations from 2000-2018 can be found in Appendix X.

Significant regulatory changed in California's recreational sector began
with a change from unlimited number of hooks and lines allowed in 1999
and prior to no more than three hooks and one line per angler in 2000.
Since 2001, the limit has been no more than two hooks and one line per
angler. There is no size limit in the recreational fishery for gopher or
black-and-yellow rockfish. GBYR are part of the nearshore complex which
has had a sub-bag limit within the rockfish bag limit since 1999. The
nearshore sub-bag limit has been 10 fish since 2005.

California also began spatial management, closures, and depth
restrictions for the recreational fleet in 2000. In general, the
recreational season north of Pt. Conception extends from April to
December, and south of Pt. Conception from March to December. In the
area that GBYR are most commonly landed, from Monterey to Morro Bay, the
depth restrictions have been between 30 and 40 fathoms until 2017. In
2017 the depth restrictions were eased by 10 fathoms, opening up fishing
depths along the central California coast that had not been open
consistently since 2002. In both 2017 and 2018, the deepest 10 fathoms
was closed prior to the season in December due to high by-catch rates of
yelloweye rockfish, one of two rockfish species that are still
overfished. A full history of the recrational regulations relating to
teh spatial management of the fleet can be found in Appendix XXX.

\subsection{Management Performance}\label{management-performance-1}

NEED TO FINISH\\
The contribution of GBYR to the minor nearshore rockfish OFLs is
currently derived from two sources: 1) forecasts from Key et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Key2005}{2005}), from Cape Mendocino to Pt.
Conception and 2) a Depletion Corrected Average Catch (DCAC (MacCall
\protect\hyperlink{ref-MacCall2009}{2009})) for the area south of Point
Conception. Estimated catch of GBYR has been\ldots{}\ldots{} A summary
of these values as well as other base case summary results can be found
in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}.

\subsection{Fisheries Off Mexico or
Canada}\label{fisheries-off-mexico-or-canada}

The range of GBYR does not extend north to the Canadian border, and they
are rarely encountered in Oregon and Washington. The southern end of the
gopher rockfish's range extends to Punta San Roque (southern Baja
California) whiel the southern end of the black-and-yellow rockfish's
range extends to Isla Natividad (central Baja California) (Love et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Love2002}{2002}). This was no available
information on the fishery for GBYR at the time of this assessment, nor
additional details on the abundance or distribution patterns in Mexican
waters.

\section{Assessment}\label{assessment}

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

Data used in the GBYR assessment are summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:data_plot}. Descriptions of the data sources are in the
following sections.

\subsubsection{Commercial Fishery
Landings}\label{commercial-fishery-landings}

\emph{Overview of gopher and black-and-yellow catch history}

Commercial fishery landings for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes
have not been reported consistently by species throughout the available
catch history (Figure \ref{fig:Catches_livedeadNS_gby}). The period from
1916-1935 indicates that only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed in
the commercial fishery, which then switched to predominately gopher
rockfish from 1937-1984. From 1985-1988 the landings data suggest that
only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed and not until 1995 are both
species well-represented in the catches. There is no way to tease apart
the historical catches by species and even across north and south of Pt.
Conception prior to about 1995. This precludes the ability to model the
catch histories for either species accurately. Given these constraints,
all commercial data were combined to represent one commercial fleet in
the assessment.

The stock assessment of gopher rockfish in 2005 did not include
black-and-yellow rockfish landings. A comparison of recreational and
commercial landings from the 2005 assessment to those used in this
assessment suggest the 2005 assessment may have included some
black-and-yellow rockfish landings (Figure
\ref{fig:Assessment_compare}). The 2005 assessment estimated
recreational landings from 1969-1980 based on a ratio of commercial to
recreational landings, where as this assessment makes use of the
California Catch Reconstruction landings estimates (Ralston et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}).

\emph{Commercial Landings Data Sources}

The California Catch Reconstruction (Ralston et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}) contains landings estimates
of commercial landings from 1916-1968 and was queried on 4 April 2019
for GBYR. There were no estimated gopher rockfish landings prior to
1937. Landings in this database are divided into trawl and `non-trawl.'
Since the majority of GBYR are caught in the commercial fixed gear
fisheries, only estimated catch in the `non-trawl' was used. A total of
0.154 mt (3.18\%) were removed from Eureka commercial landings (based on
current proportions of commercial catch from north of Cape Mendocino in
Eureka) since the assessment represents the GBYR stock south of Cape
Mendocino. The majority of GBYR commercial landings (avg. 83\%) are
landed in the Monterey and Morro Bay port complexes.

Contemporary landings were extracted from two data sources, the
California Cooperative Groundfish Survey,
\href{https://calcom.psmfc.org/}{CALCOM}) and the Pacific Fisheries
Information Network \href{https://pacfin.psmfc.org/}{PacFIN} landings
database.Both databases are based on the same data sources (CALCOM
data), but apply a catch expansion based on different algorithms. CALCOM
collects information including species composition data (i.e.~the
proportion of species landed in a sampling stratum), and landing
receipts (sometimes called ``fish tickets'') that are a record of pounds
landed in a given stratum. Strata in California are defined by market
category, year, quarter, gear group, port complex, and disposition (live
or dead). Although many market categories are named after actual
species, catch in a given market category can consist of several
species. These data form the basis for the ``expanded''" landings, i.e.,
species composition data collected by port samplers were used to
allocate pounds recorded on landing receipts to species starting in
1978. Use of the ``Gopher Rockfish'' or the ``Black-and-Yellow
Rockfish'' categories alone to represent actual landings of GBY would
not be accurate.

See Pearson et al. Appendix C
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pearson2008}{2008}) for a simple example of the
expansion calculations for the CALCOM database. A description of the
landings in PacFIN can be found in Sampson and Crone
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sampson1997}{1997}). Both databases, including
species compositions, and expanded landings estimates are stored at the
Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, a central repository of
commercial landings data for the U.S. West Coast. As a note, CALCOM is
the only source for landings from 1969-1980.

Commercial landings from 1981-2018 were queried for a final time from
the CALCOM database on 4 April 2019 and from PacFIN on 3 June 2019.
There are very small ifferences in commercial landings between CALCOM
and PacFIN from 1981-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:Calcom_vs_Pacfin}). Landings
estimates from PacFIN were used in the assessment (Table
\ref{tab:CommCatches}). Landings were stratified by year, quarter,
live/dead, market category, gear group, port complex, and source of
species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed samples, or
assumed nominal market category). Data from individual quarters were
aggregated at the year level. Fish landed live or dead were combined,
due to changes over time in the reliability of condition information (D.
Pearson, pers. comm.). From 1916-1968, on average, 74\% of GBYR were
landed north of Point Conception, which rose to 97\% from 1978-2018.
Given the smaller landings south of Pt. Conception and the similar
length composition of GBYR north and south of Pt. Conception, no spatial
separation was considered for the commercial fleet.

\subsubsection{Commercial Discards}\label{commercial-discards}

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) provides observer
data on discarding across fishery sectors back to 2003. Gopher and
black-and-yellow rockfishes have different depth-stratified commercial
fishery discard mortality rates (Pacific Fishery Managment Council
\protect\hyperlink{ref-PSMFC2018}{2018}). In consultation with WCGOP
staff, the STAT used estimates of total discard mortality from WCGOP's
Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) report. WCGOP observes
between 1-5\% of nearshore fixed gear landings annually south of
\(40^\circ 10^\prime\) N. latitude (coverage rates available
\href{https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/sector_products.cfm\#ob}{here}).
The expanded estimates of total discard weight by species is calculated
as the ratio of the observed discard weight of the individual species
divided by the observed landed weight\\
from PacFIN landing receipts. WCGOP discard estimates for the nearshore
fixed gear fishery take into account the depth distribution of landings
in order to appropriately apply the depth-stratified discard mortality
rates by species (Somers, K.A., J. Jannot, V. Tuttle, K. Richerson and
McVeigh \protect\hyperlink{ref-Somers2018}{2018}). The discard mortality
for 2018 was estimated as an average of the discard mortality from
2013-2017. Discard mortality was estimated from the period prior to
WCGOP discard estimates (1916-2002) based on the average discard
mortality rate from 2003-2016 (2017 was excluded because 2017 discard
mortality was disproportionately higher than all other years) (Table
\ref{tab:CommCatches}).

\subsubsection{Commercial Fishery Length and Age
Data}\label{commercial-fishery-length-and-age-data}

Biological data from the commercial fisheries that caught GBYR were
extracted from CALCOM on 9 May 2019. The CALCOM length composition data
were catch-weighted to ``expanded'' length the raw length composition
data (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). The 2005 assessment used
commercial length composition information from CALCOM, but did not
include black-and-yellow rockfish and is not directly comparable. The
2005 assessment used 2 cm length bins from 16-40 cm, where this
assessment uses 1 cm length bins from 4-40 cm. Sex was not available for
the majority (99.5\%) of the commercial length, and the assessment did
not find sexual dimorphism in growth for either species. We aggregated
the commercial length composition among all gears and regions south of
Cape Mendocino.

Discard length compositions from WCGOP (2003-2017) were expanded based
on the the discard estimates and were aggregated for all regions south
of Cape Mendocino and across all fixed gear fisheries.

A total of 46 ages were available for gopher rockfish from the
commercial fisheries 2009-2011, 2016, and 2018. Though sparse, the data
were included as conditional age-at-length for the commercial fleet.

The input sample sizes for commercial length composition data were
calculated via the Stewart Method for fisheries (Ian Stewart, personal
communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

Commercial length composition data are made available from PacFIN and
the expanded catch-weight legnth compositions were provided by Andi
Stephens (NWFSC) processed through the
\href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/PacFIN.Utilities}{PacFIN
Utilities} package. We compares differences between the catch-weighted
length composition expansions from CALCOM and PacFIN. We were unable to
reconcile the difference between the two dataset. Sample sizes became
more similar if the PacFIN data were restricted to the same market
categories used by CALCOM in the expansion. However, both datasets apply
other filters that we did not have time to explore. For instance, in the
year 2000, 290 more fish were used in the CALCOM expansion than in
PacFIN, but in 2002, 150 more fish were used in the PacFIN expansions
that were not used in CALCOM. Given these caveats, Figure
\ref{fig:Calcom_vs_pacfin_lengths} shows the percent difference in the
expanded length comps within a year. The biggest difference is in length
bin 32 in 2006. However, the same number of fish and samples were used
to expand the 2006 lengths in both databases, indicating there are also
fundamental differences in how the data are treated. Full documentation
is not available for the PacFIN length composition expansion program.
The base model for this assessment uses the CALCOM length compsition
data as described above, but a sentistivy was conducted using the PacFIN
length composition data.

\subsubsection{Recreational Fishery Removals and
Discards}\label{recreational-fishery-removals-and-discards}

\emph{Historical recreational landings and discard, 1928-1980}

Ralston et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}) reconstructed
estimates of recreational rockfish catch and discard in California,
1928-1980. Reported landings of total rockfish were allocated to species
based on several sources of species composition data. Estimates of GBYR
landings and discard (combined) from 1928-1979 are available from the
SWFSC. For this assessment, historical recreational catch was stratified
by year and area (north and south of Point Conception). The catches of
GBYR reported in Ralston et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}) are higher by an order of
magnitude than expected given the more recent catches of GBYR in the
MRFSS and CRFS eras south of Pt. Conception (Figure
\ref{fig:Catches_original}). The recreational catches estimated by
Ralston et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}) were
discussed with the paper's co-authors and also CPFV captains in
California. A consensus was reached that the estimated landings did not
accurately represent the historical GBYR landings and an alternative
catch stream should be developed. One possibility for the inflated
catches of GBYR in southern California is that all nearshore shallow
species were combined and all of the nearshore deep species were
combined and a constant relative fraction between the two was used to
assign catches to each combination of CDFW fishing block and year. The
fraction of GBYR within the nearshore shallow species group was likely
overestimated.

The California Catch Reconstruction applied a linear ramp from from
1928-1936 that was not altered in this assessment. From 1937-1979 a
linear ramp was developed from the 1936 estimate to the average
recreational landing from 1980 and 1983 (1981-1982 catches interpolated
as described in the next section) of 4.3 mt. The recreational catches
north of Pt. Conception were not altered from the original catch
reconstruction. The resulting alternate recreational catch streams are
in (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal} and Figure \ref{fig:Catches_alternate}).

\emph{Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS),
1980-2003}

From 1980-2003, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey
(MRFSS) executed a dockside (angler intercept) sampling program in
Washington, Oregon, and California (see Holliday et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Holliday1984}{1984}) for a description of
methods). Data from this survey are available from the Recreational
Fisheries Information Network \href{www.recfin.org}{RecFIN}. RecFIN
serves as a repository for recreational fishery data for California,
Oregon, and Washington. Catch estimates for years 1980-2003 were
downloaded on 23 March 2019, and are consistent from 1992-2004 with the
previous assessment (Key et al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Key2005}{2005})
(Figure \ref{fig:Assessment_compare}).

MRFSS-era recreational removals for California were estimated for two
regions: north and south of Point Conception. No finer-scale estimates
of landings are available for this period. Catches were downloaded in
numbers and weight. Catch in weight is sometimes missing from the
database due to missing average weight estimates. We estimated average
weights based on adjacent strata as needed, although the effect was
relatively minor (7.4 mt over all years for gopher rockfish and 0.6 mt
for black-and-yellow rockfish). Data were not available for the CPFVs in
Northern California from 1980-1982, and we used the average value from
this mode and region from 1983-1987 for these three years. MRFSS
sampling was temporarily suspended from 1990-1992, and we used linear
interpolation to fill the missing years. Sampling of CPFVs in Northern
California was further delayed, and the linear interpolation spans the
period 1990-1995 for this boat mode and region. Landings data for the
shore-based modes (beach/bank, man-made/jetty and shore) were sparse
throughout the MRFSS sampling. All three shore-based modes were combined
by region and linear interpolations were applied missing data in 1981
for the Northern California and 1995, 1996-2001, and 2004 in Southern
California.

Catches from north of Cape Mendocino were removed based on a CRFS-era
average of fraction of recreational landings north of Cape Mendocino by
mode (3.3\% of shore-based, 0.1\% of CPFV, and 0.2\% of private/rental
were removed). From 1980-1989, San Luis Obispo County was sampled as
part of Southern California (personal observation from MRFSS Type 3
sampler examined catch where county is available for 1980-2004). This
assessment separates the recreational fleet at Pt. Conception.
Recreational landings were re-allocated from southern California from
1980-1992 by fleet based on the average proportion of recreational
landings in northern California from 1996-2004 (after sampling of the
CPFV fleet in northern California resumed). The average proportion
re-allocated from southern to northern California for the CPFV mode was
85\%, 97\% for the private/rental mode, and 81\% for the shore-based
modes. Data were pooled over all years and modes to estimate the
landings re-allocation for the shore-based modes. Total recreational
landings for 1981 and 1982 were 18.8 mt and 18.6 mt, respectively. These
landings were \textgreater{}60 mt lower than any of the neighboring
years. Landings from 1981-1982 were interpolated from the 1980 and 1983
landings.

\emph{California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2016}

MRFSS was replaced with the California Recreational Fisheries Survey
(CRFS) beginning January 1, 2004. Among other improvements to MRFSS,
CRFS provides higher sampling intensity, finer spatial resolution (6
districts vs.~2 regions), and onboard CPFV sampling. Estimates of catch
from 2004-2018 were downloaded from the RecFIN database a final time on
4 June 2019, We queried and aggregated CRFS data to match the structure
of the MRFSS data, by year, and region (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}).
Catches in the shore-based modes are small compared to the CPFV and
private rental modes. All modes are combined, but separated at Point
Conception for two recreational fleets in this assessment, just as was
done for the California Catch Reconstruction and MRFSS time series.

\emph{Recreational Discard}

Recreational discards were only added to the California Catch
Reconstruction landings, as Ralston et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ralston2010}{2010}) did not address discards for
the recreational reconstruction. Recreational removals from the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife MRFSS era (1980-2003)
includes catch type A + B1. Catch type A refers to estimates of catch
based on sampler-examined catch. Catch type B1 includes mainly
angler-reported discard, but also angler-reported retained fish that
were unavailable to the sampler during the interview (e.g., fillets).
The CRFS era removals account for depth-stratified discard mortality
rate and the catch time series includes both retained and discarded
catch (total mortality). We calculated the ratio of dead discards to
total mortality from the CRFS era by region and mode. The region average
across modes was applied to the California Catch Reconstruction as a
constant. The result added 4.68\% annually to recreational removals
north of Pt. Conception and 4.05\% annually to the removals South of Pt.
Conception). The final time series of landings and discard mortality are
in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

\subsubsection{Recreational Fishery Length and Age
Data}\label{recreational-fishery-length-and-age-data}

Recreational length composition samples for California were obtained
from several sources, depending on the time period and boat mode (Table
\ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). This assessment makes use of a much
longer time series of length composition data, relative to the previous
assessment, as described below. Input sample sizes for recreational
length composition data were based on the number of observed trips, when
available. Other proxies that were used to estimate the number of trips
are described below.

There were no standardized coastwide surveys measure retained or
discarded fish from the recreational fleet prior to 1980.

\emph{CPFV length composition data, 1959-1978}

The earliest available length data for this assessment were described by
Karpov et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Karpov1995}{1995}), who assembled
a time series (1959-1972) of available California CPFV length data (made
available courtesy of W. Van Buskirk). For GBYR, data from 1959-1961 and
1966 were available north of Pt. Conception and from 1959-1961 from
south of Pt Conception. A total of 716 (680 north of Pt. Conception)
unsexed measuremenst of retained fish (no discards) were included in the
assessment (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). Sampling of these
length data did not follow a consistent protocol over time and areas
(data are unweighted), and therefore may not be representative of total
catch. Since the number of trips sampled was not reported by Karpov et
al. (1995), we assume the number of sampled trips is proportional to the
number of measured fish in each year, and estimated the number of trips
using the ratio of fish measured per trip in the MRFSS data (roughly 10
fish per trip).

Collins and Crooke (n.d.) conducted an onboard observer survey of the
CPFV fleet in southern California from 1975-1978. A total of 1,308 GBYR
lengths were available from the study and were assumed to all be from
retained fish. Ally et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ally1991}{1991})
conducted an onboard observer program of the CPFV fleet from 1985-1987
in southern California. Because MRFSS data were available for this time
period as well and represents multiple recreational modes, the Ally et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ally1991}{1991}) length data were not used
in the assessment.

\emph{MRFSS Recreational Length Data, 1980-1989 and 1993-2003}

Unsexed length data of retained fish were collected by MRFSS dockside
samplers and downloaded from the RecFIN website. We identified a subset
of lengths that were converted from weight measurements, and these were
excluded from the final data set (Table
\ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). The length measurements from Collins
and Crooke (n.d.) from 1975-1978 are assumed to all be from retained
fish. As of 2003, the CDFW Onboard Observer program has taken length
measurements for discarded fish. The retained catch is measured during
the dockside (angler intercept) surveys.

The number of CPFV trips used as initial sample sizes for the MRFSS was
based on the number of CPFV trips was determined from the trip-level
MRFS CPFV database and the number of private boat trips was determined
based on unique combinations of the variables ASSNID ,ID\_CODE,
MODE\_FX, AREA\_X, DIST, INTSITE, HRSF, CNTRBTRS, SUB\_REG, WAVE, YEAR,
and CNTY in the Type 3 (sampler-examined catch) data.

During the recent restructuring of the CRFS data on RecFIN, a ``trip''
identifier was not carried over for all modes, and trip-level sample
sizes could not be extracted from the biological detail table on RecFIN.
A proxy for initial sample sizes for 2004-2018 were developed using the
2015 data for which I had access to raw data files by mode from CDFW.\\
In more recent years, sampling of the shore-based modes has declined and
were not sampled at all in 2018. Samples sizes were calculated by mode
as the number of port-days (or site-days for shore-based modes) during
bi-weekly intervals (e.g., Jan 1-15, Jan 16-31, etc). The number of
port-days sampled in the bi-weekly intervals was used as the initial
sample size for number of trips to calculate initial input sample sizes
using Ian Stewart's method (described above). All length data were
re-weighted in the assessment model.

Data}\label{biological-parameters-and-data}

Neither gophr nor black-and-yellow rockfish have forked tails, therefore
total legnth and fork length are equal. All of the data provided for
this assessment were either in fork length or total length.

\textbf{Length and Age Compositions}

Length compositions were provided from the following sources:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,topsep=0pt]
  \item CALCOM (\emph{commercial retained dead fish}, 1987, 1992-2018)

\end{itemize}

The length composition of all fisheries aggregated across time by fleet
is in Figure \ref{fig:comp_lendat_aggregated_across_time}. Descriptions
and details of the length composition data are in the above section for
each fleet or survey.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Age Structures}

A total of 2,467 otoliths were incorporated in this assessment and a
summary by source can be found in Table \ref{tab:Age_data}. Gopher
rockfish comprised 80\% of the samples (946 females, 901 males, 121
unknown sex), and all but a few black-and-yellow rockfish (247 females,
232 males, 20 unknown sex) came from a directed study by Jody Zaitlin
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zaitlin1986}{1986}) (Figure
\ref{fig:growth_samples}).

Of the available ages, 91\% were collected during fishery-independent
surveys.\\
An additional 36 otoliths were collected by Cal Poly during their CPFV
onboard observer survey in 2018. The remaining 7.5\% were from
commercial port samples or recreational dockside surveys.
Black-and-yellows represent 20\% of the samples collected, and are
mainly derived from Ralph Larson's work in Monterey Bay.

All otoliths were read by Don Pearson (NMFS SWFSC, now retired) and ages
ranged from 1-28. The aged black-and-yellow rockfish ranged in length
from 7-32 cm with a mean of 24 cm and gopher rockfish ranged in length
from 11-36 cm, with a mean of 26. In terms of ages, the black-and-yellow
rockfish ranged from 2-19 and gophers from 2-28. Fits to the von
Bertalanffy growth curve (Bertalanffy
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vonB1938}{1938}),
\(L_i = L_{\infty}e^{(-k[t-t_0])}\), where \(L_i\) is the length (cm) at
age \(i\), \(t\) is age in years, \(k\) is rate of increase in growth,
\(t_0\) is the intercept, and \(L_{\infty}\) is the asymptotic length,
were explore by species and sex.

No significant differences were found in growth between males and
females, or between gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Aging Precision and Bias}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Weight-Length}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Sex Ratio, Maturity, and Fecundity} Gopher Females
mature at 20.7 cm and live to 24 years old. Mature females in Central
California release larvae between January and July ({\textbf{???}} et.
al. 2002).

Black-and-yellow Females mature at 17 cm producing 25,000 - 450,000 eggs
spawning from January to May. One brood is released per season for both
black and yellow and gopher rockfish ({\textbf{???}} et. al. 2002).

Females reach 50\% maturity at 17.5 cm or 4 years of age in Central
California and were 100\% mature by age 6, with the same age of maturity
found in southern California though individuals were smaller at age
(Zaitlin 1986).

\subsubsection{Environmental or Ecosystem Data Included in the
Assessment}\label{environmental-or-ecosystem-data-included-in-the-assessment}

In this assessment, neither environmental nor ecosystem considerations
were explicitly included in the analysis. This is primarily due to a
lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) that
could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the
assessment.

\subsubsection{Modeling Software}\label{modeling-software}

The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.05.03 by Dr.~Richard
Methot at the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it
included improvements and corrections to older versions. The r4SS
package (GitHub release number v1.27.0) was used to post-processing
output data from Stock Synthesis.

\subsubsection{Data Weighting}\label{data-weighting}

\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}

The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a
meta-analysis completed by Hamel
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hamel2015}{2015}), as described under ``Natural
Mortality.'' Female natural mortality was fixed at the median of the
prior, 0.xxx for an assumed maximum age of xx. An uninformative prior
was used for the male offset natural mortality, which was estimated.

The prior for steepness (\emph{h}) assumes a beta distribution with
parameters based on an update for the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn,
M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), which was endorsed by the Science and
Statistical Committee in 2018. The prior is a beta distribution with
\(mu\)=0.xxx and \(sigma\)=0.xxx. Steepness is fixed in the base model
at the mean of the prior. The priors were applied in sensitivity
analyses where these parameters were estimated.

\subsubsection{Estimated and Fixed
Parameters}\label{estimated-and-fixed-parameters}

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables

\subsection{Base Case Model Results}\label{base-case-model-results}

The following description of the model results reflects a base model
that incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see
previous section). The base model parameter estimates and their
approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table
\ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in Table
\ref{tab:like_components}. Estimates of derived reference points and
approximate 95\% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table
\ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}. Time-series of estimated stock size over time
are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

\subsubsection{Parameter Estimates}\label{parameter-estimates}

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each
year's input variability) for all surveys was estimated within the
model.

(Figure
\ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ).

The stock-recruit curve \ldots{} Figure \ref{fig:SR_curve2} with
estimated recruitments also shown.

\subsubsection{Fits to the Data}\label{fits-to-the-data}

Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition,
survey length composition, and conditional age-at-length observations
are all discussed below.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty and Sensitivity
Analyses}\label{uncertainty-and-sensitivity-analyses}

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Sensitivity 1
  
  \item Sensitivity 2
  
  \item Sensitivity 3
  
  \item Sensitivity 4
  
  \item Sensitivity 5, etc/
  
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Retrospective Analysis}\label{retrospective-analysis}

\subsubsection{Likelihood Profiles}\label{likelihood-profiles}

\subsubsection{Reference Points}\label{reference-points-1}

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and
catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model,
(2017). Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) were 169 mt
when using an \(SPR_{50\%}\) reference harvest rate and with a 95\%
confidence interval of 104 mt based on estimates of uncertainty. The
spawning biomass equivalent to 40\% of the unfished level
(\(SB_{40\%}\)) was 554 mt.

(Figure
\ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The 2018 spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning
biomass is above/below the target of 40\% of unfished levels (Figure
\ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}).
The relative fishing intensity, \((1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})\), has been xxx
the management target for the entire time series of the model.

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference
points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows
the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value xxx.
