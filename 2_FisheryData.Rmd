Descriptions of the data sources are in the following sections.

###Commercial Fishery Landings

Commercial landings in California are based on two primary data sources: 
a cooperative port sampling program (California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, 
[CALCOM](https://calcom.psmfc.org/)) that collects information including species 
composition data (i.e. the proportion of species landed in a sampling stratum), 
and landing receipts (sometimes called “fish tickets”) that are a record of pounds 
landed in a given stratum. Strata 
in California are defined by market category, year, quarter, gear group, port 
complex, and disposition (live or dead). Although many market categories are 
named after actual species, catch in a given market category can consist of 
several species. All landings used in this assessment are “expanded” landings, 
i.e., species composition data collected by port samplers were used to allocate 
pounds recorded on landing receipts to species. Use of the “Gopher Rockfish”
or the "Black-and-Yellow Rockfish" categories alone to represent actual landings 
of GBY would not be accurate. See Pearson et al. Appendix C [-@Pearson2008] for 
a simple example of the expansion calculations. Data from the California Cooperative
Groundfish Survey, species compositions, and expanded landings estimates are stored in 
the CALCOM database at the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, a central repository 
of commercial landings data for the U.S. West Coast.

Commercial catches of black-and-yellow rockfish from 1916-1968 and for gopher rockfish 
from 1937-1968 were queried (4 April 2019) from the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010].
Landings in this database are divided into trawl and ‘non-trawl.’ Since the majority of 
GBYR are caught in the commercial fixed gear fisheries, only estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ was used.  A total of 0.154 mt (3.18%) were removed from Eureka commercial landings 
(based on current proportions of commercial catch from north of Cape Mencodino in Eureka) since 
the assessment represents the GBYR stock south of Cape Mendocino. 

Commercial landings from 1969-2018 were queried for a final time from the CALCOM 
database on 4 April 2019 (Table \ref{tab:commCatches}. Commercial landings were also queried 
from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Inforamtion Network) for a final time on 3 June 2019 for comparison 
to CALCOM landings. There are very small differences in commercial landings between CALCOM and 
PacFIN from 1981-2018 (Figure \ref:fig:Calcom_vs_Pacfin}).  Landings estiamtes from CALCOM were 
used in the assessment. Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, 
gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed 
samples, or assumed nominal market category). Data from individual quarters were aggregated at the 
year level. Fish landed live or dead were combined, due to changes over time in the reliability 
of condition information (D. Pearson, pers. comm.). From 1916-1968, on average, 74% of GBYR were 
landed north of Point Conception, which rose to 97% from 1978-2018. Given the smaller landings 
south of Point Conception and the similar length composition of GBYR north and south of Pt. 
Conception, no spatial separation was considered for the commercial fleet.


###Commercial Discards

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) provides observer data on 
discarding practices across sectors back to 2003. Gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes have different depth-stratified commercial fishery discard mortality 
rates [@PSMFC2018]. In consultation with WCGOP staff, the STAT used estimates 
of total discard mortality from WCGOP’s Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear 
(GEMM) report. WCGOP observes between 1-5% of nearshore fixed gear landings annually 
south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (coverage rates available [here](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/sector_products.cfm#ob)). 
The expanded estimates of total discard by species is calculated as the ratio of the 
discard of the individual species observed by WCGOP divided by the observed landings 
from PacFIN landing receipts. WCGOP discard estimates for the nearshore fixed gear fishery 
take into account the depth distribution of landings in order to appropriately apply 
the depth-stratified discard mortality rates by species [@Somers2018]. The discard 
mortality for 2018 was estimated as 
an average of the discard mortality from 20213-2017. Discard mortality was estimated from the 
period prior to WCGOP discard estimates (1916-2002) based on the average discard mortality 
rate from 2003-2016 (2017 was excluded because 2017 discard mortality was disproportionately higher 
than all other years) (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}).



###Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data


The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart Method (Ian Stewart, personal 
communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


###Sport Fishery Removals and Discards

Three data sources were used to estimate retained and discard mortality for the 
recreational fishing fleet; the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010] 
and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS 
(2004-2018) databases. 

*Historical recreational landings and discard, 1928-1980*
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] reconstructed estimates of recreational rockfish 
catch and discard in California, 1928-1980. Reported landings of total rockfish 
were allocated to species based on several sources of species composition data. 
Estimates of GBYR landings and discard (combined) from 1928-1979 are available 
from the SWFSC. For this assessment, historical recreational catch was stratified 
by year and area (north and south of Point Conception).  The catches of GBYR 
reported in Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] are higher than expected given the 
more recent catches of GBYR south of Pt. Conception and the species' ranges 
(Figure \ref{fig:Catches_original}).  The California Catch Reconstruction used 
a linear from from 1928-1936 that was not altered.  From 1937-1979 linear ramp 
to the average recreational landing from 1980 and 1983 (1981-1982 catches 
interpolated as described in the next section) of 4.3 mt. The recreational catches 
north of Pt. Conception were not altered from the original catch reconstruction.
The resulting alternate recreational catch streams are in (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Catches_alternate}).

*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2016*

*Recreational Discard*


There was a lapse in MRFSS sampling from 1990 through 1992, 
for which retained catch and discard mortality were estimated using the average of 
values three years before and three years after the lapse for all modes other than 
the party/charter mode.  For the party/charter mode, estimates of numbers 
of fish were available from logbook data and average weight from the three years 
before and after this period were applied to provide estimates for the party/charter mode. 


Estimates of retained catch and discards were not available from the non-party/charter modes 
prior to 1980, thus the ratio of catch in the party/charter mode to the other modes for 1980 
through 1985 was used to provide an estimate of catch in the other modes in the 
years 1932-1979.  In the case of the private/rental mode, a linear ramp in the ratio adjustment 
between party/charter and private/rental modes was applied between 1966 and 1979 from 0.55 in 1980 to 0.10 
in 1965, reflecting the increase in the relative proportion of catch contributed by 
the private/rental mode with time as more individuals anglers purchased vessels, as recommended 
in the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010], and the ratio of 0.10 was assumed
for all years prior.  The ratio of party/charter estimates to the man-made structure (MM) 
and beach/bank (BB) modes was assumed constant and the average between 1980 and 1989 was applied 
from 1932 to 1979.  Catch 
estimates from CPFV logbooks were not available during the World War II era from 1941
until 1946 and catch was assumed to be zero for all modes during this period.  Estimates
for retained catch and discarded mortality for 1928 to 3528 were estimated using a
linear ramp from the value for 1936 to zero in 1928 for the party/charter mode and ratios party/charter 
compared to other modes were used to proxy estimates for other modes based on the 
resulting ramped values for the party/charter mode.  The final time series of landings and discard 
mortality are in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

Biological samples from the recreational fleets are described in the sections below.
