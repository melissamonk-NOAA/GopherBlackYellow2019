###Commercial Fishery Landings

*Overview of gopher and black-and-yellow catch history*

Commercial fishery landings for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes have not 
been reported consistently by species throughout the available catch history 
(Figure \ref{fig:Catches_livedeadNS_gby}). The period from 1916-1935 indicates 
that only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed in the commercial fishery, which then 
switched to predominately gopher rockfish from 1937-1984.  From 1985-1988 the landings 
data suggest that only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed and not until 1995 are 
both species well-represented in the catches. There is no way to tease apart the 
historical catches by species and even across north and south of Pt. Conception prior 
to about 1995. 
This precludes the ability to model the catch histories for either species 
accurately. Given these constraints, all commercial data were combined to represent 
one commercial fleet in the assessment.

The stock assessment of gopher rockfish in 2005 did not include black-and-yellow rockfish 
landings. A comparison of recreational and commercial landings from the 2005 assessment 
to those used in this assessment suggest the 2005 assessment may have included some 
black-and-yellow rockfish landings (Figure \ref{fig:Assessment_compare}). The 2005 
assessment estimated recreational landings from 1969-1980 based on a ratio of commercial 
to recreational landings, where as this assessment makes use of the California Catch 
Reconstruction landings estimates [@Ralston2010]. 


*Commercial Landings Data Sources*

The California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010] contains landings estimates of 
commercial landings from 1916-1968 and was queried on 4 April 2019 for GBYR.  There 
were no estimated gopher rockfish landings prior to 1937.
Landings in this database are divided into trawl and ‘non-trawl.’ Since the majority of 
GBYR are caught in the commercial fixed gear fisheries, only estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ was used.  A total of 0.154 mt (3.18%) were removed from Eureka commercial landings 
(based on current proportions of commercial catch from north of Cape Mendocino in Eureka) since 
the assessment represents the GBYR stock south of Cape Mendocino. The majority of GBYR commercial 
landings (avg. 83%) are landed in the Monterey and Morro Bay port complexes.


Contemporary landings were extracted from two data sources, 
the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, 
[CALCOM](https://calcom.psmfc.org/)) and the Pacific Fisheries 
Information Network [PacFIN](https://pacfin.psmfc.org/) landings 
database.Both databases are based on the same data sources (CALCOM data), but 
apply a catch expansion based on different algorithms. CALCOM collects 
information including species 
composition data (i.e. the proportion of species landed in a sampling stratum), 
and landing receipts (sometimes called “fish tickets”) that are a record of pounds 
landed in a given stratum. 
Strata in California are defined by market category, year, quarter, gear group, port 
complex, and disposition (live or dead). Although many market categories are 
named after actual species, catch in a given market category can consist of 
several species. These data form the basis for the "expanded"" landings,
i.e., species composition data collected by port samplers were used to allocate 
pounds recorded on landing receipts to species starting in 1978. 
Use of the “Gopher Rockfish” or the "Black-and-Yellow Rockfish" categories 
alone to represent actual landings 
of GBY would not be accurate. 

See Pearson et al. Appendix C [-@Pearson2008] for a simple example of the expansion 
calculations for the CALCOM database. A description of the landings in PacFIN 
can be found in Sampson and Crone [-@Sampson1997].  Both databases, including
species compositions, and expanded landings estimates are stored at the Pacific 
States Marine Fisheries Commission, a central repository 
of commercial landings data for the U.S. West Coast. As a note, CALCOM is the only source for 
landings from 1969-1980.  

Commercial landings from 1981-2018 were queried for a final time from the CALCOM 
database on 4 April 2019 and from PacFIN on 3 June 2019. There are very small 
ifferences in commercial landings between CALCOM and 
PacFIN from 1981-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:Calcom_vs_Pacfin}).  Landings estimates 
from PacFIN were used in the assessment (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}). 
Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, 
gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port 
samples, borrowed samples, or assumed nominal market category). Data from 
individual quarters were aggregated at the year level. Fish landed live 
or dead were combined, due to changes over time in the reliability of 
condition information (D. Pearson, pers. comm.). From 1916-1968, on 
average, 74% of GBYR were landed north of Point Conception, which
rose to 97% from 1978-2018. Given the smaller landings south of 
Pt. Conception and the similar length composition of GBYR north and south of Pt. 
Conception, no spatial separation was considered for the commercial fleet.

 
###Commercial Discards

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) provides observer data on 
discarding across fishery sectors back to 2003. Gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes have different depth-stratified commercial fishery discard mortality 
rates [@PSMFC2018]. In consultation with WCGOP staff, the STAT used estimates 
of total discard mortality from WCGOP’s Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear 
(GEMM) report. WCGOP observes between 1-5% of nearshore fixed gear landings annually 
south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (coverage rates available [here](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/sector_products.cfm#ob)). 
The expanded estimates of total discard weight by species is calculated as the ratio of the 
observed discard weight of the individual species divided by the observed landed weight  
from PacFIN landing receipts. WCGOP discard estimates for the nearshore fixed gear fishery 
take into account the depth distribution of landings in order to appropriately apply 
the depth-stratified discard mortality rates by species [@Somers2018]. The discard 
mortality for 2018 was estimated as 
an average of the discard mortality from 2013-2017. Discard mortality was estimated from the 
period prior to WCGOP discard estimates (1916-2002) based on the average discard mortality 
rate from 2003-2016 (2017 was excluded because 2017 discard mortality was disproportionately higher 
than all other years) (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}).


###Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data

Biological data from the commercial fisheries that caught GBYR were extracted from CALCOM 
on 9 May 2019. The CALCOM length composition data were catch-weighted to "expanded" length 
the raw length composition data (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). The 2005 assessment
used commercial length composition 
information from CALCOM, but did not include black-and-yellow rockfish and is not directly
comparable.  The 2005 assessment used 2 cm length bins from 16-40 cm, where this assessment 
uses 1 cm length bins from 4-40 cm. Sex was not available for the majority (99.5%) of the 
commercial length, and the assessment did not find sexual dimorphism in growth for either 
species.  We aggregated the commercial length composition among all gears and regions south 
of Cape Mendocino.

Discard length compositions from WCGOP (2003-2017) were expanded based on the the discard estimates and
were aggregated for all regions south of Cape Mendocino and across all fixed gear fisheries.

A total of 46 ages were available for gopher rockfish from the commercial fisheries 2009-2011, 2016, 
and 2018.  Though sparse, the data were included as conditional age-at-length for the commercial fleet. 

The input sample sizes for commercial length composition data were calculated via the Stewart 
Method for fisheries (Ian Stewart, personal communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


Commercial length composition data are made available from PacFIN and the expanded catch-weight 
legnth compositions were provided by Andi Stephens (NWFSC) processed through the 
[PacFIN Utilities](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/PacFIN.Utilities) package. 
We compares differences between the catch-weighted length composition expansions from
CALCOM and PacFIN.  We were unable to reconcile the difference between the two dataset. 
Sample sizes became more similar if the PacFIN data were restricted to the same market 
categories used by CALCOM in the expansion.  However, both datasets apply other filters that
we did not have time to explore. For instance, in the year 2000, 290 more fish were used in 
the CALCOM expansion than in PacFIN, but in 2002, 150 more fish were used in the PacFIN expansions 
that were not used in CALCOM. Given these caveats, Figure \ref{fig:Calcom_vs_pacfin_lengths} shows 
the percent difference in the expanded length comps within a year.  The biggest difference is 
in length bin 32 in 2006. However, the same number of fish and samples were used to expand the 
2006 lengths in both databases, indicating there are also fundamental differences in how the 
data are treated.  Full documentation is not available for the PacFIN length composition 
expansion program.  The base model for this assessment uses the CALCOM length compsition 
data as described above, but a sentistivy was conducted using the PacFIN length composition data.

###Recreational Fishery Removals and Discards

*Historical recreational landings and discard, 1928-1980*

Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] reconstructed estimates of recreational rockfish 
catch and discard in California, 1928-1980. Reported landings of total rockfish 
were allocated to species based on several sources of species composition data. 
Estimates of GBYR landings and discard (combined) from 1928-1979 are available 
from the SWFSC. For this assessment, historical recreational catch was stratified 
by year and area (north and south of Point Conception).  The catches of GBYR 
reported in Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] are higher by an order of magnitude than 
expected given the more recent catches of GBYR in the MRFSS and CRFS eras south of 
Pt. Conception (Figure \ref{fig:Catches_original}). The recreational catches estimated 
by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] were discussed with the paper's co-authors and also CPFV 
captains in California. A consensus was reached that the estimated landings did not 
accurately represent the historical GBYR landings and an alternative 
catch stream should be developed. One possibility for the inflated catches of GBYR in 
southern California is that all nearshore shallow species were combined and all of the 
nearshore deep species were combined and a constant relative fraction between the two 
was used to assign catches to each combination of CDFW fishing block and year. The fraction 
of GBYR within the nearshore shallow species group was likely overestimated.

The California Catch Reconstruction applied 
a linear ramp from from 1928-1936 that was not altered in this assessment.
From 1937-1979 a linear ramp was developed from the 1936 estimate
to the average recreational landing from 1980 and 1983 (1981-1982 catches 
interpolated as described in the next section) of 4.3 mt. The recreational catches 
north of Pt. Conception were not altered from the original catch reconstruction.
The resulting alternate recreational catch streams are in (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Catches_alternate}).


*Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003*

From 1980-2003, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) executed
a dockside (angler intercept) sampling program in Washington, Oregon, and California 
(see Holliday et al. [-@Holliday1984] for a description of methods). 
Data from this survey are available from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network 
[RecFIN](www.recfin.org). RecFIN serves as a repository for recreational fishery data 
for California, Oregon, and Washington. Catch estimates for years 1980-2003 were downloaded 
on 23 March 2019, and are consistent from 1992-2004 with the previous assessment [@Key2005]
(Figure \ref{fig:Assessment_compare}). 

MRFSS-era recreational removals for California were estimated for two regions: 
north and south of Point Conception. No finer-scale estimates of landings are 
available for this period. Catches were downloaded in numbers and weight. 
Catch in weight is sometimes missing from the database due to missing average 
weight estimates. We estimated average weights based on adjacent strata as 
needed, although the effect was relatively minor (7.4 mt over all years for 
gopher rockfish and 0.6 mt for black-and-yellow rockfish). Data were not 
available for the CPFVs in Northern California from 1980-1982, and we used 
the average value from this mode and region from 1983-1987 for these three 
years. MRFSS sampling was temporarily suspended from 1990-1992, and we used 
linear interpolation to fill the missing years. Sampling of CPFVs in Northern 
California was further delayed, and the linear interpolation spans the period 
1990-1995 for this boat mode and region. Landings data for the shore-based 
modes (beach/bank, man-made/jetty and shore) were sparse throughout the MRFSS 
sampling.  All three shore-based modes were combined by region and linear 
interpolations were applied missing data in 1981 for the Northern California 
and 1995, 1996-2001, and 2004 in Southern California.

Catches from north of Cape Mendocino were removed based on a CRFS-era average of
fraction of recreational landings north of Cape Mendocino by mode (3.3% of 
shore-based, 0.1% of CPFV, and 0.2% of private/rental were removed).
From 1980-1989, San Luis Obispo County was sampled as part of Southern California 
(personal observation from MRFSS Type 3 sampler examined catch where county is 
available for 1980-2004). This assessment separates the recreational fleet at 
Pt. Conception. Recreational landings were re-allocated from southern California 
from 1980-1992 by fleet based on the average proportion of recreational landings in 
northern California from 1996-2004 (after sampling of the CPFV fleet in northern 
California resumed).  The average proportion re-allocated from southern to northern 
California for the CPFV mode was 85%, 97% for the private/rental mode, and 81% for 
the shore-based modes.  Data were pooled over all years and modes to estimate the 
landings re-allocation for the shore-based modes.  Total recreational landings for 
1981 and 1982 were 18.8 mt and 18.6 mt, respectively.  These landings were >60 mt 
lower than any of the neighboring years.  Landings from 1981-1982 were interpolated 
from the 1980 and 1983 landings.


*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2016*

MRFSS was replaced with the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) 
beginning January 1, 2004. Among other improvements to MRFSS, CRFS provides 
higher sampling intensity, finer spatial resolution (6 districts vs. 2 regions), 
and onboard CPFV sampling. Estimates of catch from 2004-2018 were downloaded 
from the RecFIN database a final time on 4 June 2019, We queried and aggregated 
CRFS data to match the structure of the MRFSS data, by year, and region 
(Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}).  Catches in the shore-based modes are small 
compared to the CPFV and private rental modes.  All modes are combined, but separated 
at Point Conception for two recreational fleets in this assessment, just as was done 
for the California Catch Reconstruction and MRFSS time series.

*Recreational Discard*

 Recreational discards were only added to the California Catch Reconstruction 
landings, as Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] did not address discards for the 
recreational reconstruction.  Recreational removals from the California Department 
of Fish and Wildlife MRFSS era (1980-2003) includes catch type A + B1. Catch type 
A refers to estimates of catch based on sampler-examined catch. Catch type B1 
includes mainly angler-reported discard, but also angler-reported retained fish 
that were unavailable to the sampler during the interview (e.g., fillets). 
The CRFS era removals account for depth-stratified 
discard mortality rate and the catch time series includes both retained and 
discarded catch (total mortality).  We calculated the ratio of dead discards to 
total mortality from the CRFS era by region and mode.  The region average across 
modes was applied to the California Catch Reconstruction as a constant.  The result 
added 4.68% annually to recreational removals north of Pt. Conception and 4.05%  annually 
to the removals South of Pt. Conception). The final time series of landings and discard 
mortality are in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

###Recreational Fishery Length and Age Data

Recreational length composition samples for California were obtained from 
several sources, depending on the time period and boat mode 
(Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). This assessment 
makes use of a much longer time series of length composition data, relative 
to the previous assessment, as described below. Input sample sizes for recreational 
length composition data were based on the number of observed trips, when available.
Other proxies that were used to estimate the number of trips are described below.

There were no standardized coastwide surveys measure retained or discarded fish from 
the recreational fleet prior to 1980. 

*CPFV length composition data, 1959-1978*

The earliest available length data for this assessment were described by 
Karpov et al. [-@Karpov1995], who assembled a time series (1959-1972) of available 
California CPFV length data (made available courtesy 
of W. Van Buskirk).  For GBYR, data from 1959-1961 and 1966 were available north of Pt. 
Conception and from 1959-1961 from south of Pt Conception. A total of 716 (680 north of 
Pt. Conception) unsexed measuremenst of retained fish (no discards) were included in 
the assessment (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). Sampling of these length
data did not follow a consistent protocol over time and 
areas (data are unweighted), and therefore may not be representative of total catch. Since 
the number of trips sampled was not reported by Karpov et al. (1995), we assume the number 
of sampled trips is proportional to the number of measured fish in each year, and estimated 
the number of trips using the ratio of fish measured per trip in the MRFSS data (roughly 10 
fish per trip). 

Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] conducted an onboard observer survey of the CPFV fleet 
in southern California from 1975-1978.  A total of 1,308 GBYR lengths were available from the 
study and were assumed to all be from retained fish. Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] conducted an 
onboard observer program of the CPFV fleet from 1985-1987 in southern California.  Because 
MRFSS data were available for this time period as well and represents multiple recreational 
modes, the Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] length data were not used in the assessment.


*MRFSS Recreational Length Data, 1980-1989 and 1993-2003*

Unsexed length data of retained fish were collected by MRFSS dockside samplers 
and downloaded from the RecFIN website. We identified a subset of lengths that were 
converted from weight measurements, and these were excluded from the final data set 
(Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). The length measurements from
Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] from 1975-1978 are assumed to all be from retained fish. 
As of 2003, the CDFW Onboard Observer program has taken length measurements for discarded fish. 
The retained catch is measured during the dockside (angler intercept) surveys.

The number of CPFV trips used as initial sample sizes for the MRFSS was based on 
the number of CPFV trips was determined from the trip-level MRFS CPFV database 
and the number of private boat trips was determined based on unique combinations 
of the variables ASSNID ,ID_CODE, MODE\_FX, AREA\_X, DIST, INTSITE, 
HRSF, CNTRBTRS, SUB\_REG, WAVE, YEAR, and CNTY in the Type 3 
(sampler-examined catch) data.

During the recent restructuring of the CRFS data on RecFIN, a "trip" identifier was not 
carried over for all modes, and trip-level sample sizes could not be extracted from the
biological detail table on RecFIN. A proxy for initial sample sizes for 2004-2018 were 
developed using the 2015 data for which I had access to raw data files by mode from CDFW.  
In more recent years, sampling of the shore-based modes has declined and 
were not sampled at all in 2018.  Samples sizes were calculated by mode as the number of 
port-days (or site-days for shore-based modes) during bi-weekly intervals 
(e.g., Jan 1-15, Jan 16-31, etc).  The number of port-days sampled in the bi-weekly intervals 
was used as the initial sample size for number of trips to calculate initial input sample sizes 
using Ian Stewart's method (described above). All length data were re-weighted in the assessment model.
