###Commercial Fishery Landings

*Overview of gopher and black-and-yellow catch history*

Commercial fishery landings for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes have not 
been reported consistently by species throughout the available catch history 
(Figure \ref{fig:Catches_livedeadNS_gby}). The period from 1916-1935 indicates 
that only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed in the commercial fishery, which then 
switched to predominately gopher rockfish from 1937-1984.  From 1985-1988 the landings 
data suggest that only black-and-yellow rockfish were landed and not until 1995 are 
both species well-represented in the catches. There is no way to tease apart the 
historical catches by species and even across north and south of Pt. Conception prior 
to about 1995. 
This precludes the ability to model the catch histories for either species 
accurately. Given these constraints, all commercial data were combined to represent 
one commercial fleet in the assessment.

The stock assessment of gopher rockfish in 2005 did not include black-and-yellow rockfish 
landings. A comparison of recreational and commercial landings from the 2005 assessment 
to those used in this assessment suggest the 2005 assessment may have included some 
black-and-yellow rockfish landings (Figure \ref{fig:Assessment_compare}). The 2005 
assessment estimated recreational landings from 1969-1980 based on a ratio of commercial 
to recreational landings, where as this assessment makes use of the California Catch 
Reconstruction landings estimates [@Ralston2010]. 


*Commercial Landings Data Sources*

The California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010] contains landings estimates of 
commercial landings from 1916-1968 and was queried on 4 April 2019 for GBYR.  There 
were no estimated gopher rockfish landings prior to 1937.
Landings in this database are divided into trawl and ‘non-trawl.’ Since the majority of 
GBYR are caught in the commercial fixed gear fisheries, only estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ was used.  A total of 0.154 mt (3.18%) were removed from Eureka commercial landings 
(based on current proportions of commercial catch from north of Cape Mendocino in Eureka) since 
the assessment represents the GBYR stock south of Cape Mendocino. The majority of GBYR commercial 
landings (avg. 83%) are landed in the Monterey and Morro Bay port complexes.


Contemporary landings were extracted from two data sources, 
the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, 
[CALCOM](https://calcom.psmfc.org/)) and the Pacific Fisheries 
Information Network [PacFIN](https://pacfin.psmfc.org/) landings 
database.Both databases are based on the same data sources (CALCOM data), but 
apply a catch expansion based on different algorithms. CALCOM collects 
information including species 
composition data (i.e. the proportion of species landed in a sampling stratum), 
and landing receipts (sometimes called “fish tickets”) that are a record of pounds 
landed in a given stratum. 
Strata in California are defined by market category, year, quarter, gear group, port 
complex, and disposition (live or dead). Although many market categories are 
named after actual species, catch in a given market category can consist of 
several species. These data form the basis for the "expanded"" landings,
i.e., species composition data collected by port samplers were used to allocate 
pounds recorded on landing receipts to species starting in 1978. 
Use of the “Gopher Rockfish” or the "Black-and-Yellow Rockfish" categories 
alone to represent actual landings 
of GBY would not be accurate. 

See Pearson et al. Appendix C [-@Pearson2008] for a simple example of the expansion 
calculations for the CALCOM database. A description of the landings in PacFIN 
can be found in Sampson and Crone [-@Sampson1997].  Both databases, including
species compositions, and expanded landings estimates are stored at the Pacific 
States Marine Fisheries Commission, a central repository 
of commercial landings data for the U.S. West Coast. As a note, CALCOM is the only source for 
landings from 1969-1980.  

Commercial landings from 1981-2018 were queried for a final time from the CALCOM 
database on 4 April 2019 and from PacFIN on 3 June 2019. There are very small 
differences in commercial landings between CALCOM and 
PacFIN from 1981-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:Calcom_vs_Pacfin}).  Landings estimates 
from PacFIN were used in the assessment (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}). 
Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, 
gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port 
samples, borrowed samples, or assumed nominal market category). Data from 
individual quarters were aggregated at the year level. Fish landed live 
or dead were combined, due to changes over time in the reliability of 
condition information (D. Pearson, pers. comm.). From 1916-1968, on 
average, 74% of GBYR were landed north of Point Conception, which
rose to 97% from 1978-2018. Given the smaller landings south of 
Pt. Conception and the similar length composition of GBYR north and south of Pt. 
Conception, no spatial separation was considered for the commercial fleet.

 
###Commercial Discards

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) provides observer data on 
discarding across fishery sectors back to 2003. Gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes have different depth-stratified commercial fishery discard mortality 
rates [@PSMFC2018]. In consultation with WCGOP staff, the STAT used estimates 
of total discard mortality from WCGOP’s Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear 
(GEMM) report. WCGOP observes between 1-5% of nearshore fixed gear landings annually 
south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (coverage rates available [here](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/sector_products.cfm#ob)). 
The expanded estimates of total discard weight by species is calculated as the
ratio of the observed discard weight of the individual species divided by the observed 
landed weight from PacFIN landing receipts. WCGOP discard estimates for the 
nearshore fixed gear fishery take into account the depth distribution of 
landings in order to appropriately apply the depth-stratified discard 
mortality rates by species [@Somers2018]. The discard mortality for 2018 
was estimated as an average of the discard mortality from 2013-2017. Discard 
mortality was estimated from the period prior to WCGOP discard estimates 
(1916-2002) based on the average discard mortality rate from 2003-2016 
(2017 was excluded because 2017 discard mortality was disproportionately higher 
than all other years) (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}).


###Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data

Biological data from the commercial fisheries that caught GBYR were extracted 
from CALCOM on 9 May 2019. The CALCOM length composition data were catch-weighted 
to "expanded" length the raw length composition data (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). 
The 2005 assessment used commercial length composition information from CALCOM,
but did not include black-and-yellow rockfish and is not directly comparable. 
The 2005 assessment used 2 cm length bins from 16-40 cm, where this assessment 
uses 1 cm length bins from 4-40 cm. Sex was not available for the majority 
(99.5%) of the commercial length, and the assessment did not find sexual 
dimorphism in growth for either species.  We aggregated the commercial 
length composition among all gears and regions south of Cape Mendocino.

Discard length compositions from WCGOP (2003-2017) were expanded based on the the 
discard estimates and were aggregated for all regions south of Cape Mendocino 
and across all fixed gear fisheries.

A total of 46 ages were available for gopher rockfish from the commercial 
fisheries 2009-2011, 2016, and 2018.  Though sparse, the data were included as 
conditional age-at-length for the commercial fleet. 

The input sample sizes for commercial length composition data were calculated 
via the Stewart Method for fisheries (Ian Stewart, personal communication, IPHC):

\begin{center}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{center}


Commercial length composition data are made available from PacFIN and the expanded 
catch-weight length compositions were provided by Andi Stephens (NWFSC) processed 
through the [PacFIN Utilities](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/PacFIN.Utilities) 
package. We compares differences between the catch-weighted length composition 
expansions from CALCOM and PacFIN.  We were unable to reconcile the difference 
between the two data sets. Sample sizes became more similar if the PacFIN data 
were restricted to the same market categories used by CALCOM in the expansion. 
However, both data sets apply other filters that we did not have time to explore. 
For instance, in the year 2000, 290 more fish were used in the CALCOM expansion 
than in PacFIN, but in 2002, 150 more fish were used in the PacFIN expansions 
that were not used in CALCOM. Given these caveats, Figure \ref{fig:Calcom_vs_pacfin_lengths} 
shows the percent difference in the expanded length comps within a year.  The 
biggest difference is in length bin 32 in 2006. However, the same number of 
fish and samples were used to expand the 2006 lengths in both databases, 
indicating there are also fundamental differences in how the data are treated. 
Full documentation is not available for the PacFIN length composition 
expansion program.  The base model for this assessment uses the CALCOM length 
composition data as described above, but a sensitivity was conducted using the 
PacFIN length composition data.

###Recreational Fishery Removals and Discards

*Historical recreational landings and discard, 1928-1980*

Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] reconstructed estimates of recreational rockfish 
catch and discard in California, 1928-1980. Reported landings of total rockfish 
were allocated to species based on several sources of species composition data. 
Estimates of GBYR landings and discard (combined) from 1928-1979 are available 
from the SWFSC. For this assessment, historical recreational catch was stratified 
by year and area (north and south of Point Conception).  The catches of GBYR 
reported in Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] are higher by an order of magnitude than 
expected given the more recent catches of GBYR in the MRFSS and CRFS eras south of 
Pt. Conception (Figure \ref{fig:Catches_original}). The recreational catches estimated 
by Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] were discussed with the paper's co-authors and also CPFV 
captains in California. A consensus was reached that the estimated landings did not 
accurately represent the historical GBYR landings and an alternative 
catch stream should be developed. One possibility for the inflated catches of GBYR in 
southern California is that all nearshore shallow species were combined and all of the 
nearshore deep species were combined and a constant relative fraction between the two 
was used to assign catches to each combination of CDFW fishing block and year. The fraction 
of GBYR within the nearshore shallow species group was likely overestimated.

The California Catch Reconstruction applied 
a linear ramp from from 1928-1936 that was not altered in this assessment.
From 1937-1979 a linear ramp was developed from the 1936 estimate
to the average recreational landing from 1980 and 1983 (1981-1982 catches 
interpolated as described in the next section) of 4.3 mt. The recreational catches 
north of Pt. Conception were not altered from the original catch reconstruction.
The resulting alternate recreational catch streams are in (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Catches_alternate}).


*Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003*

From 1980-2003, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) executed
a dockside (angler intercept) sampling program in Washington, Oregon, and California 
(see Holliday et al. [-@Holliday1984] for a description of methods). Data from 
this survey are available from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network 
[RecFIN](www.recfin.org). RecFIN serves as a repository for recreational fishery 
data for California, Oregon, and Washington. Catch estimates for years 1980-2003 
were downloaded on 23 March 2019, and are consistent from 1992-2004 with the 
previous assessment [@Key2005]
(Figure \ref{fig:Assessment_compare}). 

MRFSS-era recreational removals for California were estimated for two regions: 
north and south of Point Conception. No finer-scale estimates of landings are 
available for this period. Catches were downloaded in numbers and weight. 
Catch in weight is sometimes missing from the database due to missing average 
weight estimates. We estimated average weights based on adjacent strata as 
needed, although the effect was relatively minor (7.4 mt over all years for 
gopher rockfish and 0.6 mt for black-and-yellow rockfish). Data were not 
available for the CPFVs in Northern California from 1980-1982, and we used 
the average value from this mode and region from 1983-1987 for these three 
years. MRFSS sampling was temporarily suspended from 1990-1992, and we used 
linear interpolation to fill the missing years. Sampling of CPFVs in Northern 
California was further delayed, and the linear interpolation spans the period 
1990-1995 for this boat mode and region. Landings data for the shore-based 
modes (beach/bank, man-made/jetty and shore) were sparse throughout the MRFSS 
sampling.  All three shore-based modes were combined by region and linear 
interpolations were applied missing data in 1981 for the Northern California 
and 1995, 1996-2001, and 2004 in Southern California.

Catches from north of Cape Mendocino were removed based on a CRFS-era average of
fraction of recreational landings north of Cape Mendocino by mode (3.3% of 
shore-based, 0.1% of CPFV, and 0.2% of private/rental were removed).
From 1980-1989, San Luis Obispo County was sampled as part of Southern California 
(personal observation from MRFSS Type 3 sampler examined catch where county is 
available for 1980-2004). This assessment separates the recreational fleet at 
Pt. Conception. Recreational landings were re-allocated from southern California 
from 1980-1992 by fleet based on the average proportion of recreational landings in 
northern California from 1996-2004 (after sampling of the CPFV fleet in northern 
California resumed).  The average proportion re-allocated from southern to northern 
California for the CPFV mode was 85%, 97% for the private/rental mode, and 81% for 
the shore-based modes.  Data were pooled over all years and modes to estimate the 
landings re-allocation for the shore-based modes.  Total recreational landings for 
1981 and 1982 were 18.8 mt and 18.6 mt, respectively.  These landings were >60 mt 
lower than any of the neighboring years.  Landings from 1981-1982 were interpolated 
from the 1980 and 1983 landings.


*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2016*

MRFSS was replaced with the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) 
beginning January 1, 2004. Among other improvements to MRFSS, CRFS provides 
higher sampling intensity, finer spatial resolution (6 districts vs. 2 regions), 
and onboard CPFV sampling. Estimates of catch from 2004-2018 were downloaded 
from the RecFIN database a final time on 4 June 2019, We queried and aggregated 
CRFS data to match the structure of the MRFSS data, by year, and region 
(Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}).  Catches in the shore-based modes are small 
compared to the CPFV and private rental modes.  All modes are combined, 
but separated at Point Conception for two recreational fleets in this 
assessment, just as was done for the California Catch Reconstruction and MRFSS 
time series.

*Recreational Discard*

 Recreational discards were only added to the California Catch Reconstruction 
landings, as Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] did not address discards for the 
recreational reconstruction.  Recreational removals from the California Department 
of Fish and Wildlife MRFSS era (1980-2003) includes catch type A + B1. Catch type 
A refers to estimates of catch based on sampler-examined catch. Catch type B1 
includes mainly angler-reported discard, but also angler-reported retained fish 
that were unavailable to the sampler during the interview (e.g., fillets). 
The CRFS era removals account for depth-stratified 
discard mortality rate and the catch time series includes both retained and 
discarded catch (total mortality).  We calculated the ratio of dead discards to 
total mortality from the CRFS era by region and mode.  The region average across 
modes was applied to the California Catch Reconstruction as a constant.  The result 
added 4.68% annually to recreational removals north of Pt. Conception and 4.05% 
annually to the removals South of Pt. Conception). The final time series of 
landings and discard mortality are in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

###Recreational Fishery Length and Age Data

Recreational length composition samples for California were obtained from 
several sources, depending on the time period and boat mode 
(Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). This assessment 
makes use of a much longer time series of length composition data, relative 
to the previous assessment, as described below. Input sample sizes for recreational 
length composition data were based on the number of observed trips, when available.
Other proxies that were used to estimate the number of trips are described below.

There were no standardized coastwide surveys measure retained or discarded fish from 
the recreational fleet prior to 1980. 

*CPFV length composition data, 1959-1978*

The earliest available length data for this assessment were described by 
Karpov et al. [-@Karpov1995], who assembled a time series (1959-1972) of available 
California CPFV length data (made available courtesy 
of W. Van Buskirk).  For GBYR, data from 1959-1961 and 1966 were available north of Pt. 
Conception and from 1959-1961 from south of Pt Conception. A total of 716 (680 north of 
Pt. Conception) unsexed measurements of retained fish (no discards) were included in 
the assessment (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). Sampling of these length
data did not follow a consistent protocol over time and 
areas (data are unweighted), and therefore may not be representative of total 
catch. Since the number of trips sampled was not reported by Karpov et al. (1995), 
we assume the number of sampled trips is proportional to the number of measured fish 
in each year, and estimated the number of trips using the ratio of fish measured per 
trip in the MRFSS data (roughly 10 fish per trip). 

Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] conducted an onboard observer survey of the 
CPFV fleet in southern California from 1975-1978.  A total of 1,308 GBYR lengths 
were available from the study and were assumed to all be from retained fish. 
Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] conducted an onboard observer program of the CPFV 
fleet from 1985-1987 in southern California.  Because MRFSS data were available 
for this time period as well and represents multiple recreational 
modes, the Ally et al. [-@Ally1991] length data were not used in the assessment.


*MRFSS Recreational Length Data, 1980-1989 and 1993-2003*

Unsexed length data of retained fish were collected by MRFSS dockside samplers 
and downloaded from the RecFIN website. We identified a subset of lengths that 
were converted from weight measurements, and these were excluded from the final 
data set (Table \ref{tab:length_samples_fishery}). The length measurements from
Collins and Crooke [-@Collins1978] from 1975-1978 are assumed to all be from 
retained fish. As of 2003, the CDFW Onboard Observer program has taken length 
measurements for discarded fish. The retained catch is measured during the 
dockside (angler intercept) surveys.

The number of CPFV trips used as initial sample sizes for the MRFSS was based on 
the number of CPFV trips was determined from the trip-level MRFS CPFV database 
and the number of private boat trips was determined based on unique combinations 
of the variables ASSNID ,ID_CODE, MODE\_FX, AREA\_X, DIST, INTSITE, 
HRSF, CNTRBTRS, SUB\_REG, WAVE, YEAR, and CNTY in the Type 3 
(sampler-examined catch) data.

During the recent restructuring of the CRFS data on RecFIN, a "trip" identifier 
was not carried over for all modes, and trip-level sample sizes could not be 
extracted from the biological detail table on RecFIN. A proxy for initial sample 
sizes for 2004-2018 were developed using the 2015 data for which I had access to 
raw data files by mode from CDFW.  In more recent years, sampling of the 
shore-based modes has declined and were not sampled at all in 2018.  Samples 
sizes were calculated by mode as the number of port-days (or site-days for 
shore-based modes) during bi-weekly intervals (e.g., Jan 1-15, Jan 16-31, etc). 
The number of port-days sampled in the bi-weekly intervals was used as the initial 
sample size for number of trips to calculate initial input sample sizes using Ian 
Stewart's method (described above). All length data were re-weighted in the assessment model. 

###Fishery-Dependent Indices of Abundance

A summary of all indices in the assessment can be found in Table \ref{tab:Index_summary}.

**MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index**

From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of recreational 
fishing fleet. The program was temporarily suspended 
from 1990-1992 due to lack of funding. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time
series was truncated at 1998 due to sampling overlap with the onboard observer program (i.e., 
the same observer samples the catch while onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside 
intercept survey for the same vessel). Each entry in the RecFIN 
Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular 
survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also 
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers 
being interviewed.  The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. 
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records 
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).

Initial trip filters included eliminating trips targeting species caught near the 
surface waters for all or part of the trip, including trips with catch of bluefin 
tuna, yellowfin tuna, skipjack, and albacore.  

The following filtering steps were applied to gopher rockfish, as well as the 
sum of the two species to represent GBYR. No filtering or indices were developed 
for black-and-yellow rockfish alone due to the sparseness in the data. In the raw 
data, unfiltered data, black-and-yellow rockfish only occurred in 48 trips that 
did not also observer gopher rockfish.  There were an additional 65 trips that 
encountered both species. There was little difference between indices developed for 
gopher-only and the GBYR complex for both north and south of Pt. Conception (Figure 
\ref{fig:MRFSS_index_compare}).  The descriptions of the filtering and data below 
represent those for the GBYR complex. 

The species composition of catch in California varies greatly with latitude.  
Therefore, Stephens-MacCall filtering was applied independently for north and 
south of Pt. Conception. Separate indices were also developed to represent two 
recreational fleets in the model.

Since recreational fishing trips target a wide variety of species, standardization
of the catch rates requires selecting trips that are likely to have fished in habitats 
containing GBYR. The Stephens-MacCall [-@Stephens2004] filtering 
approach was used to identify trips with a high probability of catching GBYR, based 
on the species composition of the catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative predictor 
species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage (at least 30 
positive trips total) to inform the binomial model. Coefficients from the Stephens-MacCall 
analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive for species which co-occur with GBYR, and negative for 
species that are not caught with GBYR. Each of these filtering steps and the resulting number of trips remaining in the sampling frame are provided in Table \ref{tab:Fleet10_11_Filter}.

*MRFSS filtering and index standardization for north of Pt. Conception*
Prior to the Stephens-MacCall filter, a total of 2,788 trips were retained for the analysis. As expected, positive indicators of GBYR trips include several species of nearshore rockfish,
treefish, kelp rockfish, and blue rockfish, and the strongest counter-indicator
was striped bass (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet10_SM_filter}). While the filter is useful 
in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted 
in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one target species can result
in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stpehens and MacCall [@Stephens2004] 
recommended including all trips above a threshold where the false negatives and false 
positives are equally balanced.  However, this does not have any biological relevance 
and for this data set, we assume that if a GBYR was landed, the anglers had to have fished 
in appropriate habitat, especially given how territorial GBYR and both species are 
strongly associated with rocky habitat.
 
Two levels of possible filtering were applied using the Stephens-MacCall filter (Table 
\ref(Fleet10_11_Filter}). The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the 
probability of occurrence (in this case 0.4) at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives." The trips selected using this criteria 
were compared to an alternative method including all the "false positive" 
trips, regardless of the probability of encountering GBYR 
(Table \ref{tab:Fleet10_contingency}). This assumes that if GBYR were caught, 
the anglers must have fished in appropriate habitat during the trip. 
The catch included in this index is "sampler-examined" and the samplers are well 
trained in species identification.  The last filter applied was to exclude years 
after 1999 due to a number of regulation changes, and years in which there were 
less than 20 observed trips. The final index is represented by 544 trips, 220 of 
which encountered GBYR.

Due to the large number of zeros in the data, we modeled catch per angler hour 
(CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) using maximum likelihood and Bayesian 
negative binomial regression. Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and area_x) factors were evaluated. Counties were grouped 
into three regions, north of Sonoma county, Sonoma county through 
Santa Cruz county, and San Luis Obispo county. Based on AIC values from maximum 
likelihood fits (Table \ref{tab:Fleet10_AIC}), a main effects model including all 
factors (year, region, area_x, and 2-month waves) was fit in the “rstanarm” R package 
(version 2.18.2). Diagnostic checks of the Bayesian model fit (Neff, Rhat, 
and Monte Carlo standard error values) were all reasonable. Predicted means by 
stratum (Year) were strongly correlated with observed means, suggesting 
a reasonable fit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet10_MLE_stan}). The NB model 
generated data sets with roughly 50-70% zeros, compared to the observed 60% 
(Figure \ref{fig:Fleet10_prop_zero_STAN}).

The index represents the years 1984-1989, 1995, 1996 and 1999. There is not a lot of 
contrast in the index, except for a small increase in 1986.  The final index values 
and associated log standard error included in the assessment can be found in Table \ref{tab:Indices}.


*MRFSS filtering and index standardization for south of Pt. Conception*
Prior to the Stephens-MacCall filter, a total of 7,334 trips were available for the analysis. 
As expected, positive indicators of GBYR trips included several nearshore species, e.g., 
kelp rockfish, treefish, and black croaker, while the strongest counter-indicator
was opaleye (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet11_SM_filter}). While the filter is useful 
in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species assuming all effort was exerted 
in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of more than one target species can result
in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. 

For consistency with the methods used north of Pt. Conception (Table 
\ref(Fleet10_11_Filter}) the index includes the trips identified as  "false 
positives" from the Stephens-MacCall filtering that had a lower threshold 
level of 0.22 (Table \ref{tab:Fleet11_contingency}). The last filter applied was 
to exclude years after 1999 due to a number of regulation changes, and years 
in which there were less than 20 observed trips. The final index is represented 
by 475 trips, 342 of which encountered GBYR.

Catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) was modelled using 
the delta-GLM approach [@Lo1992; @Stefansson1996]. A negative binomial model was 
explored, but the proportion of zeroes was not well estimated in the 
negative binomial models. This is likely due to the facts that MRFSS sampling 
effort was higher south of Pt. Conception, and GBYR 
are also rare south of Pt. Conception, both leading to a higher proportion of zeroes 
in the trip data than for north of Pt. Conception.

Model selection using Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC) supported inclusion of year, region, area_x, and 2-month waves. Counties 
were grouped into three regions,Santa Barbara to Ventura counties, Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, and San Diego county for both the positive observation model and 
the binomial model.  Area_x is a measure of distance from shore, a categorical variable 
indicating whether most of the fishing occurred inside or outside three nautical 
miles from shore.

The resulting index for south of Pt. Conception represents different years than the index 
for north of Pt. Conception (Table \ref{tab:Indices}). The index starts in 1980 with 
continuous data through 1986, and three additional years in 1996, 1998 and 1999.  
The index increases through 1983 and a marked decrease to 1986.  The index for 
the three years in the 1990s does not exhibit any significant trend.

**CPFV Onboard Observer Surveys**

Onboard observer survey data were available from three sources for this assessment, 
1) a CDFW survey in central California from 1987-1998 (referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg survey, [@Reilly1998]), 2) the CDFW survey from 1999-2018, 
and 3) a Cal Poly survey from 2003-2018.  During an onboard observer trip the 
sampler rides along on a CPFV trip and records location-specific catch and discard 
information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. 
The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people that changes 
during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather 
to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and ending 
time, number of anglers observed, 
starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish.  The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat 
for the target species.


California implemented a statewide sampling program in 1999 [@Monk2014].  California 
Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling 
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay [@Stephens2004], but follows 
the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998], and has been modified to 
reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are 
landed instead of at the level of a fisher’s bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area 
incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2018.  Cal Poly collects 
lengths of both retained and discarded fish.  

We generated separate relative indices of abundance in for the 1987-1999 and 2000-2018
data sets due to the number of regulation changes occurring throughout the time period 
(see Appendix H, p.\pageref{sec:AppendixH}). Separate indices were also developed for 
north and south of Pt. Conception.  


*Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Onboard Observer Index Filtering and Standardizatiom*
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop  were recorded at a finer scale than 
the catch data for this survey.  We aggregated the relevant location information (time and 
number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information.  Between April 1987 
and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but 
the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed 
anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers 
at each fishing stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials 
for details).  In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded 
from the analysis.  The years 1990 and 1991 were also removed for low sample sizes.  Final 
data filters included removing reefs that 
never encountered GBYR, drifts that had fishing times outside 95% of the data, and fishing 
stops with depths <9 m and >69m.  The final data set contained 2,411 fishing stops, with 
1,096 of those encountering GBYR. 

The index was fit using a delta-GLM model, with a lognormal model (AIC: 1,088) 
selected over a gamma model (AIC: 1,143) for the positive encounters. Covariates 
considered in the full model included year, depth, and month (Table \ref{tab:Fleet5_AIC}). 
The model selected by AIC for both the lognormal and binomial components of the 
delta-GLM included year, depth and reef.  Depth was included in 10 m depth bins and eight reefs were 
select in the final model (Figure coming). The final index did not indicate an increasing 
trend that was seen in the 2005 gopher rockfish assessment using the same data set (Figure \ref{fig:DebWV_index_compare}). A number of reasons include that finer-scale location data 
was keypunched in 2012 for this survey, the index in this assessment includes black-and-yellow 
rockfish, and different filters were applied to the data. However, the the same peaks and 
decreases in the two indices are present.

*CDFW and Cal Poly Onboard Observer Index Filtering and Standardization*
As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that Cal Poly measures 
both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers.  CDFW measures discarded 
fish only from the observed anglers, and measures retained fish as part of the angler 
interview at the bag level. Cal Poly has also begun collecting otoliths during the 
onboard observer trips, which are used as conditional age-at-length data the 
recreational fishery north of Pt. Conception in this assessment. 

A number of filters are applied to these data.  All of the Cal Poly data have been 
through a QA/QC process once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the 
data from CDFW.  Data sheets from CDFW are not longer available prior to 2012 and 
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data. 

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution.  Reefs were 
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material (xxx). 

Initial filters were applied to the entire data set, north and south of Pt. Conception 
combined. After an initial clean-up of the data, 67,850 drifts remained, with GBYR present 
in 9,317 (Table \ref{tab:Fleet6_7_Filter}).  This was reduced to 25,427 drifts GBYR 
present in 7,250 drifts) after filtering the data to remove potential outliers in the 
time fished and observed anglers, limiting the data to reefs that observed GBYR and were 
sampled in at least 2/3 of all years, and to drifts with starting locations within 1,000 m 
of a reef.

Recreational fishing trips north and south of Pt. Conception can be fundamentally different due 
to differences in habitat structure, target species, and weather.  

*Filtering and Index Standardization for north of Pt. Conception*
The number of drifts remaining before region specific filtering was 13,792, with 
6,036 drifts encountering GBYR (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet6_7_Filter}).  
Because GBYR are strongly associated with hard 
bottom habitat, the distance from a reef at the start of a drift was re-examined 
for drifts encountering GBYR.  The maximum distance was 872 m, but the 97% quantile 
dropped to 42 m and was chosen as a reasonable cutoff value, and only resulted in a 
reduction of 182 drifts that encountered gopher rockfish. The final data were 
filtered to ensure all selected reefs were sampled in at least 2/3 of all years, 
leaving 12,965 drifts for the final index, 5,796 of which encountered GBYR.

The index of abundance was modeled with the a delta-GLM modeling approach, 
with year, month, 10 m depth bins from 10-59 m, and 12 reefs as possible 
covariates.  A lognormal model (AIC: 12,185) was selected over a gamma (AIC: 12,520) 
for the positive observations using AIC. The full model was selected by AIC for the 
lognormal and binomial components of the delta-GLM. The index indicates a relatively 
stable trend from 2001-2009 and a steady decrease from 2010-2013.  The relative index 
of abundance has increased since 2014.


*Filtering and Index Standardization for south of Pt. Conception*
The bathymetric data is not available at as fine-scale resolution for the Southern 
California Bight and more of the trips and drifts target mid-water species, including 
mid-water rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet6_7_Filter}). Therefore, instead of using 
distance to reef as a filter, we filtered the data to drifts that encountered 20% 
or more groundfish.  This resulted in the total number of drifts decreasing from 
11,635 to 5,495, but only decreased the number of drifts encountering GBYR from 
1,277 to 1,171. A final check was made to ensure all reefs were sampled in at 
least 2/3 of all years, leaving 5,440 drift for the final index, of which 1,132 
encountered GBYR.

The index of abundance was modeled with the a delta-GLM modeling approach, 
with year, month, 10 m depth bins from 10-59 m, and four reefs as possible 
covariates.  A lognormal model (AIC: 162) was selected over a gamma (AIC: 277) 
for the positive observations using AIC. A model with year, depth and reef was 
selected by AIC for both the lognormal and binomial components of the delta-GLM. 
The index indicates a relatively stable trend from 2001-2004 and a steady increase 
from 2005-2017.

<!-- ************FISHERY-INDPENDENT DATA*********************************** -->

###Fishery-Independent Data Sources
Neither of the two fishery-independent surveys described below have previously 
been used in stock assessments as indices of abundance.

**California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project**
The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project (CCFRP) is a fishery-independent 
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling 
locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs along the central California coast 
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015].  The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally
designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen. 
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored 
four MPAs consistently since then (Figure \ref{fig:CCFRP_sites}).  In 2017, the program was expanded coastwide within California.  The index of abundance was developed from the four MPAs sampled 
consistently (A\~{n}o Nuevo and Point Lobos by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras 
Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists a number 500 x 500 m cells both within and 
outside each MPA. On any given survey day for a chose site cells are randomly 
selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells).  CPFVs are chartered 
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for 
a fishing location.  During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 
45? minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, 
and can be linked back to a particular angler, and released (or descended to depth). 
Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin 
clips, needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of 
abundance, CPUE was modelled at the level of the drift, similar to the 
fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little 
filtering was needed for the index. Cells not consistently sampled over time were 
excluded as well as cells that never encountered GBYR. CCFRP samples shallower 
depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. The index was constrained to 5-39m 
in 5 m depth bins.  The final index included 4,920 drifts, 3,848 of which encountered GBYR.

We modeled catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) using maximum 
likelihood and Bayesian negative binomial regression. The proportion of zeroes in this 
data was relatively small (22%), and if overdispersion were not present, the regression 
would innately become Poisson. Models incorporating temporal (year, month) 
and geographic (MPA site and MPA vs Reference cells) factors were evaluated. Based on 
AIC values from maximum likelihood fits (Table \ref{tab:Fleet9_AIC}), a main effects 
model including all 
factors (year, month, site and MPA/REF) was fit in the “rstanarm” R package 
(version 2.18.2). Diagnostic checks of the Bayesian model fit (Neff, Rhat, 
and Monte Carlo standard error values) were all reasonable. Predicted means by 
stratum (Year) were strongly correlated with observed means, suggesting 
a reasonable fit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:Fleet9_MLE_stan}). The NB model 
generated data sets with roughly 18-22% zeros, compared to the observed 22% 
(Figure \ref{fig:Fleet10_prop_zero_STAN}).

The CCFRP index of abundance closely matches the trend observers in the onboard 
observer index from 2009-2018.  The index decreases from 2009 to 2013, and then 
exhibits the same increase through 2018.  When both indices are standardized to their 
means, the values for 2013 and 2018 are the same.
