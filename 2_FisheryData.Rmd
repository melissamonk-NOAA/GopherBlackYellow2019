###Commercial Fishery Landings

Commercial landings in California are based on two primary data sources: 
a cooperative port sampling program (California Cooperative Groundfish Survey, 
[CALCOM](https://calcom.psmfc.org/)) that collects information including species 
composition data (i.e. the proportion of species landed in a sampling stratum), 
and landing receipts (sometimes called “fish tickets”) that are a record of pounds 
landed in a given stratum. Strata 
in California are defined by market category, year, quarter, gear group, port 
complex, and disposition (live or dead). Although many market categories are 
named after actual species, catch in a given market category can consist of 
several species. All landings used in this assessment are “expanded” landings, 
i.e., species composition data collected by port samplers were used to allocate 
pounds recorded on landing receipts to species. Use of the “Gopher Rockfish”
or the "Black-and-Yellow Rockfish" categories alone to represent actual landings 
of GBY would not be accurate. See Pearson et al. Appendix C [-@Pearson2008] for 
a simple example of the expansion calculations. Data from the California Cooperative
Groundfish Survey, species compositions, and expanded landings estimates are stored in 
the CALCOM database at the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, a central repository 
of commercial landings data for the U.S. West Coast.

Commercial catches of black-and-yellow rockfish from 1916-1968 and for gopher rockfish 
from 1937-1968 were queried (4 April 2019) from the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010].
Landings in this database are divided into trawl and ‘non-trawl.’ Since the majority of 
GBYR are caught in the commercial fixed gear fisheries, only estimated catch in the 
‘non-trawl’ was used.  A total of 0.154 mt (3.18%) were removed from Eureka commercial landings 
(based on current proportions of commercial catch from north of Cape Mendocino in Eureka) since 
the assessment represents the GBYR stock south of Cape Mendocino. 

Commercial landings from 1969-2018 were queried for a final time from the CALCOM 
database on 4 April 2019 (Table \ref{tab:commCatches}. Commercial landings were also queried 
from PacFIN (Pacific Fisheries Information Network) for a final time on 3 June 2019 for comparison 
to CALCOM landings. There are very small differences in commercial landings between CALCOM and 
PacFIN from 1981-2018 (Figure \ref:fig:Calcom_vs_Pacfin}).  Landings estimates from CALCOM were 
used in the assessment. Landings were stratified by year, quarter, live/dead, market category, 
gear group, port complex, and source of species composition data (actual port samples, borrowed 
samples, or assumed nominal market category). Data from individual quarters were aggregated at the 
year level. Fish landed live or dead were combined, due to changes over time in the reliability 
of condition information (D. Pearson, pers. comm.). From 1916-1968, on average, 74% of GBYR were 
landed north of Point Conception, which rose to 97% from 1978-2018. Given the smaller landings 
south of Point Conception and the similar length composition of GBYR north and south of Pt. 
Conception, no spatial separation was considered for the commercial fleet.


###Commercial Discards

The West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) provides observer data on 
discarding across fishery sectors back to 2003. Gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes have different depth-stratified commercial fishery discard mortality 
rates [@PSMFC2018]. In consultation with WCGOP staff, the STAT used estimates 
of total discard mortality from WCGOP’s Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear 
(GEMM) report. WCGOP observes between 1-5% of nearshore fixed gear landings annually 
south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude (coverage rates available [here](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/observation/data_products/sector_products.cfm#ob)). 
The expanded estimates of total discard weight by species is calculated as the ratio of the 
observed discard weight of the individual species divided by the observed landed weight  
from PacFIN landing receipts. WCGOP discard estimates for the nearshore fixed gear fishery 
take into account the depth distribution of landings in order to appropriately apply 
the depth-stratified discard mortality rates by species [@Somers2018]. The discard 
mortality for 2018 was estimated as 
an average of the discard mortality from 2013-2017. Discard mortality was estimated from the 
period prior to WCGOP discard estimates (1916-2002) based on the average discard mortality 
rate from 2003-2016 (2017 was excluded because 2017 discard mortality was disproportionately higher 
than all other years) (Table \ref{tab:CommCatches}).



###Commercial Fishery Length and Age Data


The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart Method (Ian Stewart, personal 
communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


###Sport Fishery Removals and Discards

Three data sources were used to estimate retained and discard mortality for the 
recreational fishing fleet; the California Catch Reconstruction [@Ralston2010] 
and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS 
(2004-2018) databases. 

*Historical recreational landings and discard, 1928-1980*
Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] reconstructed estimates of recreational rockfish 
catch and discard in California, 1928-1980. Reported landings of total rockfish 
were allocated to species based on several sources of species composition data. 
Estimates of GBYR landings and discard (combined) from 1928-1979 are available 
from the SWFSC. For this assessment, historical recreational catch was stratified 
by year and area (north and south of Point Conception).  The catches of GBYR 
reported in Ralston et al. [-@Ralston2010] are higher than expected given the 
more recent catches of GBYR south of Pt. Conception and the species' ranges 
(Figure \ref{fig:Catches_original}).  The California Catch Reconstruction used 
a linear from from 1928-1936 that was not altered.  From 1937-1979 linear ramp 
to the average recreational landing from 1980 and 1983 (1981-1982 catches 
interpolated as described in the next section) of 4.3 mt. The recreational catches 
north of Pt. Conception were not altered from the original catch reconstruction.
The resulting alternate recreational catch streams are in (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Catches_alternate}).


*Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS), 1980-2003*

From 1980-2003, the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) executed
a dockside (angler intercept) sampling program in Washington, Oregon, and California. 
Data from this survey are available from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network 
[RecFIN](www.recfin.org). RecFIN serves as a repository for recreational fishery data 
for California, Oregon, and Washington. Catch estimates for years 1980-2003 were downloaded 
on 23 March 2019 (), and are consistent with the previous assessment [Key2005]. - 
need to check again)

MRFSS-era recreational removals for California were estimated for two regions: 
north and south of Point Conception. No finer-scale estimates of landings are 
available for this period. Catches were downloaded in numbers and weight. 
Catch in weight is sometimes missing from the database due to missing average 
weight estimates. We estimated average weights based on adjacent strata as 
needed, although the effect was relatively minor (7.4 mt over all years for 
gopher rockfish and 0.6 mt for black-and-yellow rockfish). Data were not 
available for the CPFVs in Northern California from 1980-1982, and we used 
the average value from this mode and region from 1983-1987 for these three 
years. MRFSS sampling was temporarily suspended from 1990-1992, and we used 
linear interpolation to fill the missing years. Sampling of CPFVs in Northern 
California was further delayed, and the linear interpolation spans the period 
1990-1995 for this boat mode and region. Landings data for the shore-based 
modes (beach/bank, man-made/jetty and shore) were sparse throughout the MRFSS 
sampling.  All three shore-based modes were combined by region and linear 
interpolations were applied missing data in 1981 for the Northern California 
and 1995, 1996-2001, and 2004 in Southern California.

Catches from north of Cape Mendocino were removed based on a CRFS-era average of
fraction of recreational landings north of Cape Mendocino by mode (3.3% of 
shore-based, 0.1% of CPFV, and 0.2% of private/rental were removed).
From 1980-1989, San Luis Obispo County was sampled as part of Southern California 
(personal observation from MRFSS Type 3 sampler examined catch where county is 
available for 1980-2004). This assessment separates the recreational fleet at 
Pt. Conception. Recreational landings were re-allocated from southern California 
from 1980-1992 by fleet based on the average proportion of recreational landings in 
northern California from 1996-2004 (after sampling of the CPFV fleet in northern 
California resumed).  The average proportion re-allocated from southern to northern 
California for the CPFV mode was 85%, 97% for the private/rental mode, and 81% for 
the shore-based modes.  Data were pooled over all years and modes to estimate the 
landings re-allocation for the shore-based modes.  Total recreational landings for 
1981 and 1982 were 18.8 mt and 18.6 mt, respectively.  These landings were >60 mt 
lower than any of the neighboring years.  Landings from 1981-1982 were interpolated 
from the 1980 and 1983 landings.


*California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS), 2004-2016*

MRFSS was replaced with the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) 
beginning January 1, 2004. Among other improvements to MRFSS, CRFS provides 
higher sampling intensity, finer spatial resolution (6 districts vs. 2 regions), 
and onboard CPFV sampling. Estimates of catch from 2004-2014 were downloaded 
from the RecFIN database on 5 March 2019, We queried and aggregated CRFS data to 
match the structure of the MRFSS data, by year, mode, and region (Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

*Recreational Discard*

Estimates of discards were not available prior to 1980.  The final time series of landings and discard 
mortality are in Table \ref{tab:Rec_removal}.

Biological samples from the recreational fleets are described in the sections below.
