##Previous Assessments

###History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock
This is the first full assessment to include data for black-and-yellow rockfish. 
Black-and-yellow rockfish was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using 
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. The DB-SRA 
model assigned a 40% probability that the then recent (2008-2009) catch 
exceeded the 2010 OFL.

Gopher rockfish south of Point Conception was assessed as a data poor species in 2010 
[@Dick2010].  A Depletion-Corrected Average Catch (DCAC) model was used due to time 
constraints. The mean yield from the DCAC distribution was 25.5 mt.

Gopher rockfish north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude) 
was first assessed as a full stock assessment in 2005 [@Key2005] using SS2 (version 1.19). 
The assessment was sensitive to the CPFV onboard observer index of abundance (referred 
to as Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer index in this assessment). The final decision 
table was based around the emphasis given to the index. The stock was found to be at 97% depletion. 



###2005 Assessment Recommendations

The 2005 STAR panel only had one recommendation specific to gopher rockfish. However, they 
had a number of generic rockfish recommendations that can be found in the STAR panel report 
available [here](https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/by-species/gopher-rockfish/).

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: Additional length and age composition data should be 
  collected for gopher rockfish. This would help to characterize spatial and possibly 
  temporal variation in growth] \hfill \\

   2019 STAT response: Additional age and length data have been collected from a number of 
   sources, the majority of which have been fishery-independent studies, including 
   two master's theses focused on gopher rockfish.  Only a handful of otoliths have been 
   collected for gopher rockfish south of Point Conception.  Additional length composition 
   data are available since the last assessment.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
##Model Description
The model descriptions in the following sections reflect decisions and modelling 
choices the STAT team made prior to the STAR panel.  Changes from the pre-STAR 
base model to the final post-STAR base model are documented in the "Responses 
to the Current STAR Panel Requests" section.  During the STAR panel, the following 
structure change were made; 1) the commercial retained and commercial discard fleets 
were combined into one commercial fleet, 2) the MRFSS recreational dockside and the 
CRFS recreational onboard indices south Point Conception were removed, 3) the PISCO 
index was split into two indices, one representing fish 15 cm and larger and an 
age-0 index representing fish 6 cm or less. All of the figures and tables reflect 
the post-STAR final base model. The section on the PISCO index of abundance has been 
updated to reflect the change in the indices.

While investigating convergence issues in the cowcod assessment, Richard Methot 
(NMFS) identified an issue with the performance of the 'sfabs' function in ADMB. 
This led to poor convergence during the iterative search for $F_{SPR}$ under certain 
conditions. Dr. Methot resolved the issue, and provided a new 'safe' version of 
SS (V3.30.13.09) to the cowcod and GBYR STATs on June 28, followed by an optimized 
executable on June 30. Apart from the iterative $F_{SPR}$ search mentioned above, 
other model outputs and analyses were unaffected by the change. All of the base model 
results were run in this newest version of SS.

###Transition to the Current Stock Assessment
The first formal stock assessment for gopher rockfish was conducted in 2005 [@Key2005]. 
There are two major differences between the 2005 assessment this assessment, 1) 
this assessment models gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish as a complex, and 2) 
this assessment includes the area south of Point Conception.

The 2005 model conducted in SS2 version 1.19 was first transitioned 
to SS3.24z as a bridge model, before moving forward to SS3.30. Below, we describe the 
most important changes made since the last full assessment in 2005 
and explain rationale for each change.  Some of these items are changes due to structure 
changes with Stock Synthesis, and some denote parameters chosen for options that were not
available in SS2 (version 1.19).

Changes in the bridge model from SS2 version 1.9 to SS3.24z and SS3.30.13.09 include:

The way growth is modeled for age-0 fish has changed.  More recent versions of Stock Synthesis 
model length-at-age for fish below the first reference age (Amin) as linearly increasing 
from the initial length bin to the length given by the L_at_Amin parameter. The minimum population 
length bin was reduced from 10 cm in the 2005 assessment to 4 cm in this assessment.  The timing of 
settlement was set at July to reflect the the month at which the young-of-the-year are expected to 
be at 4 cm (Figure \ref{fig:SMURF_lengths}).  The length data leading to this decision were 
provided by Diana Baetscher (UCSC) and were collected via Standard Monitoring Unit for the 
Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) [@Ammann2004] from the UCSC-PISCO kelp forest fish survey as 
part of her dissertation work on rockfish genetics [@Baetscher2019].

This stock assessment retains a single fleet for the commercial fishery, and also 
includes a commercial discard fleet.  Data on commercial discards were not available 
for and not included in the 2005 assessment.  The decision to retain one commercial 
fleet was made by examining the length distributions across species, fishing gears, 
and space, i.e., north and south of Point Conception 
(Figure \ref{fig:Comm_lengths_justification}). There is very little difference between 
the length composition of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish landed in the commercial 
fleet north of Point Conception, which contributed 97% of the commercial landings 
from 1978-2018.  The length distributions suggest that gopher rockfish south of 
Point Conception landed dead south of Point Conception are slightly smaller 
on average than north of Point Conception.  However, there is not enough data 
available to justify splitting the commercial fishery north and south of Point 
Conception.  The length compositions of discarded fish are small in all of 
the subplots, suggesting size-based discarding.  Because Stock Synthesis is
not set up to handle depth-dependent discard mortality rates and we're modelling 
two species as a complex with differing depth-dependent discard mortality rates,
the time series of commercial discards was incorporated as a fleet.

This assessment incorporates the area south of Point Conception, which was previously 
excluded from the 2005 assessment.  The length composition data suggested that while 
the lengths of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish were similar, fish encountered 
south of Point Conception were smaller (Figure \ref{fig:Rec_lengths_justification}).
The recreational catches from the man-made/jetty mode are negligible and did not influence 
the decision to split the fleet at Point Conception. From 2005-2018, the man-made/jetty mode 
averaged 0.5% of the total recreational catch and discards north of Point Conception and 0.03% 
south of Point Conception. The similarity of the length distributions between species and 
among modes within a region were similar and justified one recreational fleet.

The 2005 model was a length-based model.  This assessment uses conditional age-at-length from 
fish aged from a number of sources (Table \ref{tab:Age_data}).

Differences in both the recreational and commercial catches used in this assessment are described 
in detail in Section \ref{fishery-information}.

The bias adjustment for recruitment deviations did not exist in SS2 (version 1.19). We set 
1973-2015 as the range of years with full bias adjustment to span the time series 
that was modeled.

The previous assessment modeled selectivity of the commercial fleet as logistic curve, 
and both parameters for the logistic selectivity were estimated. Selectivity for both the 
recreational fleet and onboard CPFV survey were modeled using the double logistic. The 
current assessment uses the six parameter double normal for all fleets for which selectivity 
is estimated and not mirrored.  The MRFSS dockside CPFV surveys and the CPFV onboard observer 
surveys are mirrored to the recreational fishing fleets, north and south of Point Conception,
respectively.

The 2005 assessment did not include any time blocks.  This assessment includes two time blocks for 
the commercial fleet (1916-1998 and 1999-2018). A 10-inch minimum size limit was placed on the 
commercial fleet in 1999, which was reflected in the CALCOM length composition data. No additional 
time blocks were added for the recreational fleet.  GBYR are a minor component of the nearshore 
rockfish complex and no significant changes were detected in the landings or length composition 
during the time when regulations changed (1999-2002).

The 2005 assessment considered two candidate fishery-dependent indices of abundance, the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer CPFV survey and a dockside intercept survey from MRFSS 
and RecFIN from 1983-2003.  However, the dockside index was removed at the request of the 
STAR panel, citing "did not provide a reliable measure of relative abundance due to changes 
in regulations and fishery targeting during the 1990s-2000s."  The current assessment uses 
a version of the MRFSS database that has been more robustly aggregated to the trip level. 
Starting in 1999, the CDFW began angler interviews.  Interviews are conducted for all the anglers 
on the boat, whereas the onboard data is only collected for a subset of anglers that changes with 
each fishing stop. Once the onboard observer program ramped up by the mid-2000s, almost all of the CPFV groundfish trips sampled as onboard observer trips were also sampled as angler interviews.  Using both the onboard observer data and the dockside interviews for this 
time period would result in developing indices from the same fish.  The fine-scale onboard observer  data provides greater detail in terms of catch and location than the angler interviews. 
The onboard observer indices do not include the years 1999 and 2000 due to the number of regulation 
changes occurring in those two years.

The fishery-independent indices are all new for this assessment; the PISCO kelp forest fish 
survey and the CCFRP hook-and-line survey.

Maturity was changed for this assessment based upon newly available data described in the biological 
specifications of this assessment.

The 2005 assessment pre-STAR base model fixed steepness for gopher rockfish at 1.0, which 
was then changed to 0.65 (the Dorn prior at the time) during the STAR panel.
In this assessment, steepness was set at 0.72, the mean of the prior developed 
from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish, with a standard deviation of 0.16 (see 
Accepted Practices Guidelines for Groundfish Stock Assessments in the supplemental 
material). 

The prior for female natural mortality was updated to the median of the prior 
from a meta-analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (see Accepted Practices Guidelines for 
Groundfish Stock Assessments in the supplemental material). Assuming a maximum age of 
28 years, the median of the prior is 0.193, close to the fixed value used in the 
2005 assessment of 0.2.

Due to the fact that the 2005 model only included gopher rockfish and excluded the area 
south of Point Conception, a complete bridge model was not developed.  Comparison of the 2005 
input data, catch streams, and indices are provided throughout the document in appropriate 
sections.

###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
There are 10 fleets in the post-STAR base model.  They include:

*Commercial*: There is one commercial fleet the includes GBYR landed 
(all gears combined) and dead discards.

*Recreational*: The recreational fishery include two fleets, one for north of Point 
Conception and one for south of Point Conception (all modes combined).

*Fishery-Dependent Surveys*: There are five fishery-dependent survey fleets, all north 
of Point Conception.  THere is one for MRFRSS CPFV dockside survey, one for the CDFW/Cal Poly 
onboard observer survey, and one from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer survey.

*Research*: There are two main sources of fishery-independent data available the CCFRP survey and 
the PISCO kelp forest fish survey. The PISCO survey was split into two indicies in the post-STAR 
base, one representing age-0 recruitment and one for fish 15+ cm. A third survey fleet is included as 
a "dummy" fleet to allow 
incorporation of additional conditional age-at-length composition data from the Zaitlin and 
Abrams theses, the Pearson groundfish cruise, and the special study conducted during the SWFSC's 
juvenile rockfish and ecosystem cruise.  This dummy fleet includes 1,067 ages of gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish. This dummy fleet does not have any length composition data or 
catches associated with it.


###Other Specifications
Stock synthesis has a broad suite of structural options available.  Where possible, 
the ‘default’ or most commonly used approaches are applied to this stock assessment.
The assessment is a one-sex model, as no significant differences in growth between 
males and females was detected in external analyses.

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not be 
representative of the total catch.  Length composition data were removed from the 
model if fewer than 20 fish were measured in a given 
year and fleet. From 1985-1989, two surveys measured fish from the recreational 
party/charter fleet, the Ally et al. [@Ally1991] onboard observer survey and the 
dockside intercept survey. The number of trips and fish sampled by the onboard 
observer survey was far greater than the MRFSS survey and were used in the model. 
Initial input sample sizes were also capped at 400 for each set of length composition 
data.

The time-series of landings begins in 1916 for the commercial fleet and in 1928 for 
the recreational fleet.  This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is 
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.
 
The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-28, where age 28 is the ‘plus-group.’ 
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 28. 
The population length bins and the length composition length bins are set at 1-cm bins from 
fish 4-40 cm.

The extra standard deviation parameter was added to all indices except the 
MRFSS dockside index for north of Point Conception  and the PISCO age-0 index since 
both had relatively large estimated variances 
associated with them.  The extra parameter was explored, but estimated to be on 
the lower bound, and was removed for the post-STAR base model. All other indices, 
including the recreational onboard observer index, CCFRP, and PISCO (15+ cm fish), 
were estimated with relatively small 
variances (10-20%) from their respective indices.  Extra variance was estimated 
for these indices in the post-STAR base model.

The following likelihood components are included in this model: catch, indices, discards, 
length compositions, age compositions, recruitment, parameter priors, and parameter soft 
bounds. See the SS technical documentation for details [@Methot2019].

Electronic SS model files including the data, control, starter, and forecast files can be 
found on the 
[PFMC ftp site](ftp://ftp.pcouncil.org/pub/!2019%20GF%20STAR%20Panels/STAR%20Panel%204%20-%20Cowcod-Gopher/).



###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.13.09 (published on 6/28/2019) 
by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.  The r4SS package 
(GitHub release number v1.35.1) was used to post-process output data from Stock
Synthesis. 

###Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0. 


As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Additionally, weighting 
using the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) 
that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, the model did not converge when 
the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood was applied to a number of the fleets with composition 
data. Given this, and the current challenges with this method described in the Stock Synthesis 
manual [@Methot2019], the Francis weightings were applied in the pre-STAR and post-STAR 
base models. The final post-STAR base model was re-weighted twice at which point the Francis 
weights stabilized.

A series of sensitivities were conducted to determine the need to estimate 
extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the survey CPUE indices, and 
described below in the Estimated Parameters section. 


###Priors
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under “Natural Mortality.” Natural mortality 
was estimated using with a prior of, 0.193 (with log-space sigma of 0.438) for an assumed 
maximum age of 28.  Natural mortality was fixed at the value of the prior in the post-STAR 
base model.

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an 
update for the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), 
which was endorsed by the Science and Statistical Committee in 2019.  The prior is a 
beta distribution with $mu$=0.72 and $sigma$=0.16. Steepness is fixed in the post-STAR 
base model at the mean of the prior. 


###Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Table 
\ref{tab:model_params}. Time-invariant, growth is estimated in 
this assessment, with all SS growth parameters being estimated. The log of the 
unexploited recruitment level for the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is 
treated as an estimated parameter. The early annual recruitment deviations begin in 1960, 
with the main recruitment deviations estimated from 1972-2018. The survey catchability 
parameters are calculated analytically (set as 
scaling factors) such that the estimate is median unbiased, which is comparable to 
the way q is treated in most groundfish assessments.   

The post-STAR base model has a total of 61 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$) and 41 recruitment deviations
  \item Five growth parameters
  \item Four index extra standard deviation parameter, and
  \item Ten selectivity parameters
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._ Five growth parameters were estimated for the one-sex model: three von 
Bertalanffy parameters and two parameters for CV as a function of length-at-age 
related to variability in length-at-age for small and large fish.

_Selectivity._  Double-normal, asymptotic selectivity was estimated for all fleets 
with estimated selectvity parameters.

Three parameters were estimated for the recreational and commercial fleets, the peak, 
the ascending width, and the selectivity at the first bin.  Only the ascending width 
parameter was estimated for the PISCO fleet for fish 15+ cm.

The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer fleet and the CCFRP fleet were mirrored to 
the recreational fleet north of Point Conception.


_Other Estimated Parameters._ Main recruitment deviations estimated from 1978 to 2018.  The 
post-STAR base model also included estimated recruitment deviations for 
the forecast years, although these have no impact on the model estimates for the current year.

Many variations of the base case model were explored during this analysis. Sensitivities 
to asymptotic vs. domed selectivity were explored for the appropriate fisheries, e.g. 
commercial fisheries and surveys, as well as estimating selectivity and mirroring fleet 
selectivities. Time blocked selectivity without the time block from 1999-2019 for the 
recreational fisheries was investigated.  

Much time was also spent tuning the advanced recruitment bias adjustment options.  
Sensitivities were performed to each of the thirteen 
advanced options for recruitment, e.g., early recruitment deviation start year, 
early recruitment deviation phase, years with bias adjustments, and maximum bias 
adjustment.  The final base model sets the first year of recruitment deviations just 
prior to when the majority of fishery/survey length composition are available.

Several models were also investigated where steepness and natural mortality were 
either estimated, fixed at their respective priors.   


_Other Fixed Parameters._ The stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the SSC approved 
steepness prior for rockfish of 0.72 and natural mortality is fixed at 0.193, the mean 
of the prior.


##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices
Key assumptions in the model are that it is appropriate to model gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfish as a complex.  The catch histories are inseparable at this time, especially for 
the early commercial landings. The biological information available also precluded complete analyses 
of difference in growth, i.e., the majority of black-and-yellow rockfish aged were small 
fish and small fish were lacking for gopher rockfish.  Data from both species were used to 
provide a complete picture of the growth curve.

The assessment is a one area model with fleets as areas for the recreational fishery.  There 
were only a handful of aged gopher rockfish from south of Point Conception, and not enough 
other biological information available that would have justified a multi-area model.



###Alternate pre-STAR Models Considered

A number of models were run with different catch histories for the recreational fleet 
south of Point Conception, given that the catch histories were modified from the original 
data.  None of the alternatives explored altered the model at any significant level 
due to the fact that the recreational catches south of Point Conception are relatively 
small. Results from select sensitivity runs compared to the base model are in Table 
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1}.

Two sensitivities were also performed altering the commercial discard catch history.  The 
discard catch was set to zero for all years prior to 2004, the year when WCGOP estimates 
were first available, and to a constant rate of 17% of the commercial landings, the maximum 
discard rate observed in the WCGOP data.  Neither of these sensitivities resulted in any 
significant change to the model outputs.

Sensitivity of the model to the spawning and settlement months were also explored.
The base model originally set settlement month to January. Both gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish settle at a small size (~2 cm) and over a course of several 
months. After exploring the young-of-the-year length data made available by 
Diana Baetscher, the timing of settlement was moved to July for the base model, 
when the majority of GBYR are 4 cm, the size of the smallest length bin.  The change of 
the timing of settlement had little effect on the model results.

Runs of the base case model estimating steepness were also considered.

A sensitivity of the model to using the commercial length composition data from PacFIN was 
also considered.  The fits changed only slightly, (increasing depletion from 0.46 
to 0.48) but given the concerns outlined in the discussion on commercial length composition 
the base model includes the commercial length compositions from CALCOM.

Sensitivities were developed to look at alternate selectivity patterns for the the commercial 
discard fleet and the CCFRP survey.  Neither of the length compositions for these fleets 
observed larger fish.  A time block for the commercial discard fishery was not considered 
since no length composition of discarded fish were available prior to 2004.

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses to the pre-STAR base
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted prior to the STAR panel, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Fixing natural mortality at the prior of 0.193
  
  \item Fixing the von Bertalanffy $k$ at the external estimate of 0.247
  
  \item Using the PacFIN expanded length composition data
  
  \item Data weighting scenarios including unweighted, harmonic means (McAllister-Ianelli method), and Francis weights

\end{enumerate}

The following sensitivities are based on the pre-STAR base model and indicate areas that
the STAT identified as either areas of uncertainty or model sensitivities outlined in the 
Accepted Practices and Guidelines document.  A summary of parameters for all sensitivity 
runs is in Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1}.

Fixing either natural mortality or the von Bertalanffy $k$ parameter results in a stock 
with higher spawning output in 2018 as compared to the base model 
(Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity1_spawnbio}).

Fixing either M or k demonstrates the negative correlation between the two parameters. 
The von Bertalanffy $k$ parameter is estimated at 0.12 when natural mortality (estimated 
at 0.21) and growth are both estimated.  When natural mortality is fixed at the prior of 
0.193, $k$ is estimated at 0.14, but the two other growth parameters, L1 and L2 do not change 
much at all.  When $k$ is fixed to the external estimate of 0.247, natural mortality is 
estimated at 0.16, and the other growth parameters both decrease. A number of additional 
sensitivities to the growth parameters will be presented at the STAR panel.

Replacing the CALCOM commercial length composition data with the PacFIN length composition 
results in the stock at an overall lower level of biomass than the base model. Depletion in 
the final year with the PacFIN length composition is 0.50, compared to 0.46 in the base model. 
A detailed discussion on the decision to use the CALCOM length composition in the base model 
can be found in the discussion commercial length and age data, 
Section (\ref{commercial-fishery-length-and-age-data}).

Data weighting is an area of uncertainty for stock assessment, and research is 
ongoing to determine the effects of data weighting and the most appropriate initial 
sample sizes for length and age composition data.  The base model used the Stewart 
sample sizes for initial sample sizes for the fishery data and either the Stewart 
sample sizes or number of "trips" for the survey sample sizes. Weighting the data 
by the harmonic mean resulted in a model with a total likelihood between the base 
model, which uses the Francis method for weighting, and the model with default 
weights (Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity2_spawnbio}). The end year spawning output is 
almost identical for the models using harmonic means and Francis weights, both 
of which down-weighted the composition data.

The Francis weights in the base model were stable, and did not tend to serially 
decrease (down-weight) any of the data sets, which has been seen in other assessments. 
The final base model re-weights the composition data only once. As discussed above 
in the data weighting section, the Dirichlet-Multinomial weighting was explored, but 
a model with a positive definite Hessian was not identified with the pre-STAR 
base model.



##Response to the Current STAR Panel Requests


\begin{description}[style=sameline]

\item[Request No. 1: Develop catch curves from age data as appropriate during 
different periods of fishing intensity according to the model.] \hfill \\
  
\textbf{Rationale:} To obtain an independent estimate of total mortality to better 
gauge natural mortality given the model uncertainty.    
    
\textbf{STAT Response:} The STAT created two catch curves using the available age 
data for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish, one for the time period pre-2000 
(629 available ages) and the second from 2000-2018 (1,791 available ages). The 
pre-2000 plot used fish aged eight and older, while the 2000-2018 plot used fish 
aged 13 and older. The estimate of total mortality (Z) was not very different 
between the two time periods, 0.37 for the earlier period and 0.36 for the later 
years. If restricted to the same ages (13 and older), the earlier period would 
have a steeper decline. 


\item[Request No. 2: Remove the indices from the Southern fleets 7 and 11 from the 
model] \hfill \\


\textbf{Rationale:} These cover a small portion of the population and would 
not be expected to have the same trends as the majority of the population, 
are in conflict with the northern trends, and there is no straightforward 
way to combine North and South indices 


\textbf{STAT Response:} The STAT removed the two fishery-dependent indices 
representing the portion of the stock south of Pt. Conception, the CDFW 
MRFSS-era dockside survey and the CDFW CRFS-era onboard observer survey index.
There were minor changes to the model, with the total likelihood going from 515 
to 511 and the estimate of natural mortality going from 0.212 to 0.219.
    

\item[Request No. 3: Add discard to commercial catch data in terms of both catch and 
compositions (by weighting comps by the number of fish discarded or retained), and 
remove selectivity time block.  Apply discard rate back in time.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} Simpler to have a single fleet for all commercial catch and the 
model is likely to better reflect the actual dynamics.   

\textbf{STAT Response:} Response under Request \#3a.

\item[Request No. 3a: Remove commercial length comp data from 2000-2003 in addition 
to request.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} Length limit imposed in 2000 but length discards not available 
until 2004. Therefore, comp data from these years are not representative of total 
removals.  
    
\textbf{STAT Response:} The STAT combined the catches from the commercial retained 
and commercial discard fleets, to create one commercial fleet representing both 
catch streams.  The length composition data from the two fleets from 2004-2017 
were combined by weighting the length compositions by the catches from each fleet. 
Compared to the pre-STAR base, the model run for request 3a, reduced the number of 
estimated parameters by 10, and resulted in a decrease in natural mortality to 0.195. 
The overall model output did not change from the base model or the changes made from 
Request \#2.


\item[Request No. 4: Split PISCO survey such that the 0-age fish (4 and 5 cm) are 
in one survey and the 15 cm+ fish are in the other.  Fix age selectivity to age-0 
only for the first fleet and use a logistic selectivity for the second fleet.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} To separate out the recruitment index in the survey and to simplify the selectivity assumptions for this fleet.
    
\textbf{STAT Response:} Response under Request \#4a.

\item[Request No. 4a: Include all years of the recruitment index developed above.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} Years with low numbers of 4 and 5 cm fish indicate low recruitment and 
provide contrast to years with large numbers of those fish.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} The STAT developed an index of abundance using only fish that 
were 5 cm or less and re-developed the length composition data for the PISCO survey 
representing fish 15 cm and larger.  The effect of splitting the PISCO index into two 
indices, one for young of the year and one representing older fish resulted in 
dampening of the age-0 recruits seen in the previous models. 


\item[Request No. 5: Remove the auto-correlation recruitment.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} Given the sensitivity run presented, auto correlation didn’t make 
much of a difference in model results, and there was not adequate evidence in the 
data for auto-correlation. 
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} Removing the auto-correlation in recruitment resulted in no 
significant change to the model output.    


\item[Request No. 6: 1) Start recruit deviation in 1978 as main recruit devs. and 
2) Start these in 2001.  Turn off all early recruit devs in both cases.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} The composition data does not seem to be informing the estimates 
of the recruitment deviations but maybe driven by the artifacts in the catch data. 
The early recruit deviations are uninformed and all in one direction.  Recruitment 
indices start in 2001. 
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} Starting the recruitment deviations in 2001 did not produce 
a reasonable recruitment signal.  Starting the recruitment deviations in 1978 
provided reasonable recruitment deviations and is a more appropriate starting 
year given the lack of sufficient length data prior to this time period.  


\item[Request No. 7: Start from model shown at request 6(1). Fix M at 0.193 and let the model estimate k. Change the ramp to estimated level with up ramp from 1978 to 1979.  Provide all appropriate diagnostics.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} : STAT and STAR agree this was an improvement over the original base model.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} Requests 7 and 8 were conducted for comparison and the plots 
comparing the two requests are below Request 8.  Fixing natural mortality at the mean 
of the prior results in an increase in the growth parameter $k$ from 0.145 to 0.147 
from Request \#6 due to the decrease in the modeled natural mortality rate.  


\item[Request No. 8: Determine if 6cm or larger fish should be included in PISCO 
recruitment index.  If so, update the PISCO index and include the updated index in 
the model from request \#7 (above). ] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} Better to use all appropriate data for the recruitment index.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} After and email discussion with Mark Carr, Dan Malone 
(UCSC PISCO) and Darren Johnson (CSU Long Beach) it was decided that fish of 
length 6 cm at the end of the year of birth would still all be young of the 
year fish during the months in which the PISCO survey is conducted.  Additional 
research is needed to verify the appropriate lengths to include, perhaps by month. 
The PISCO age-0 index developed for this request resulted in a decrease the recruitment 
index in the early 2000s, and an increase in the recruitment index in 2010 and 
from 2014-2018 relative to include only 4 and 5 cm individuals. The resulting 
models in the plot that used the revised PISCO age-0 index of abundance are 8b, 
which fixes an issue in the selectivity mirroring, and 8c, which additionally fixes 
the last year of bias adjustment to 2019 and not 2020.  With natural mortality 
fixed at 0.193, the growth parameter $k$ is estimated at 0.114. The estimate of 
length at age-2 (L1) is 13.37, similar to the external estimates. 


\item[Request No. 9: Mirror the DebWV\_CPFV selectivity to the RecN selectivity. 
Fix the start logit parameter for the adult PISCO selectivity to zero.  Investigate 
appropriate methods for modeling selectivity for CCFRP.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} These will result in more appropriate and parsimonious treatment 
of selectivity.
  
\textbf{STAT Response:} The selectivity for the CCFRP index was also mirrored to the 
Recreational North fleet since the length compositions were not drastically different 
than the other fleets mirrored to the Recreational North fleet. The STAT could not 
find a domed selectivity pattern that had reasonable parameter estimates.  

\item[Request No. 10: Perform a drop one out analysis for the index fleets.] \hfill \\

\textbf{Rationale:} To investigate the influence each of these data sets on the model.

\textbf{STAT Response:} No single index had a substantial effect on the model output. 
Each index contributed to the status of the stock, with some indicating a an increase 
over the base model developed for Request 9, and some estimating a decreased stock status. 
Depending on which index was dropped, the year(s) of high recruitment predicted in the 
early 1990s did shift, and was either attributed to a single year, or spread over a few 
years. The PISCO age-0 index does inform recruitment and age-0 recruitment is dampened 
n recent years when this index is excluded.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
##Post-STAR Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel. A comparison 
of the pre-STAR base model and the post-STAR base model can be found in 
Figures \ref{fig:preSTAR_postSTAR_compare_spawnbio}, 
\ref{fig:preSTAR_postSTAR_compare_Bratio}, and 
\ref{fig:preSTAR_postSTAR_compare_recruit} and Table \ref{tab:preSTAR_postSTAR_compare}. 
A number of changes to the 
fleet structures, removal of surveys south of Point Conception, and the splitting 
of the PISCO index into two indices to better reflect life stages contributed to 
the changes.  The final model also fixes natural mortality, whereas it was estimated 
in the pre-STAR base model. The pre-STAR base model includes and ageing error matrix that 
was developed using only half of the available double reads.  The post-STAR base includes 
the updated ageing error matrix (Figure \ref{fig:GBY_age_error_updated}), and the update 
did not significantly change the model outputs. The remainer of the document referencing 
the base model (or base case) refers to the post-STAR base model.

The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic 
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood 
components are in Table \ref{tab:like_components}. Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

Steepness of the assumed Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship was fixed at 0.72, and
natural mortality was fixed at 0.193.  


###Convergence
Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed 
values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better 
minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal 
distribution logistically transformed into each parameter’s range [@Methot2019]. This 
was repeated 300 times and the minimum was reached in 67% of the runs  (Table \ref{tab:jitter}).
The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001,
when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting 
the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability.  We did sensitivity runs for 
convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total 
log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.

###Parameter Estimates
The base model produces estimates of growth parameters different from the external 
estimates (Figure \ref{fig:growth_compare}).  The external estimate of the von Bertalanffy 
growth coefficient $k$ 
was 0.247, whereas the internal estimate was much lower at 0.107. Using the Schnute 
parameterization with the age for L1 set at 2 and L2 at 23, the external estimates of lengths 
at Amin and Amax were similar at 13.80 and 28.22, respectively.  The internal estimates of 
the lengths for Amin and Amax were 13.4 and 28.80, respectively. Given that natural mortality 
was fixed in the base model and natural mortality and the growth parameter $k$ are negatively 
correlated, the model estimated a slower rate of growth.  A number of other factors including the 
lenght composition and selectivity affect the internal estimate of growth.  Hence, growth was 
chosen as the axis of uncertainty for the decision table.

The estimated selectivities for all fleets within the model are shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}.
The selectivity curves for the commercial fleet, recreational fleets north and 
south of Point Conception, and the larger PISCO (15+ cm) were estimated. All of 
the selectivities are asymptotic except for the PISCO age-0 index, which has an 
age selectivity set to 1.0. All of the recreational indices and the CCFRP index 
selectivities were mirrored to the recreational fleet north of Point Conception. 
Attempts to fit asymptotic and dome-shaped selectivity to the CCFRP data resulted in 
poor estimation, large standard deviations, or a lack of fit to the data. The aggregated 
CCFRP length composition over time was similar to the length composition data of the 
recreational fleets north of Point Conception and mirroring the CCFRP selectivity provided 
a more parsimonious model.  The recreational fleet south of Point Conception encounters 
smaller GBYR, which is reflected in the asymptotic selectivity shifted to the left of all 
other fleets. Selectivities for the recreational fleet north of Point Conception and the commercial 
fleet are very similar. Both fleets include both length composition of retained 
and discarded fish, although no information on the size of discards is available from 
the commercial fleet prior to 2004.  The selectivity for the commercial fleet was kept 
separate because the fleet has different fishing behavior than the recreational fleet and going 
forward in time, may diverge further from the fleets depending on management decisions or 
changes in fishing behavior.  Selectivity for the PISCO (15+ cm fish) index was estimated 
as the survey observes a  wider range of length classes than the other fleets.  The estimated 
peak of the PISCO selectivity hit the upper bound of 38 and was fixed at 38 in the base model. 
The age selectivity for the PISCO age-0 index was fixed at 1.0 and assumes that all age-0 
fish are selected.

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys except the recreational dockside index north of Point Conception 
(RecDocksideNorth) and the PISCO age-0 index, was estimated within the model.
The added variance for Deb's onboard observer survey was estimated at 
`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_DebCPFV(4)", 3], 3)`.
The added variances were highest for the recreational onboard observer survey north of 
Point Conception
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecOnboardNorth(5)", 3], 3)`)
PISCO (`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_PISCO(6)", 3], 3)`), and 
CCFRP (`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CCFRP(7)", 3], 3)`).

Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1978-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:recdevs2_withbars}). 
Estimates of recruitment suggest that GBYR are characterized by cyclical years of high 
and low recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:Recruit_mod1}). The final base model does not include
early recruitment deviation and a steep bias adjustment ramp from 1978 to 1979 of 0.32 that 
extends to 2019 Figure \ref{fig:recruit_fit_bias_adjust}. The years of highest estimated 
recruitment is 1991, with recruitment estimated more than double that of any other year.  
Fish from this cohort can be observed in the lenght composition data from Deb Wilson Vandenberg's
onboard observer survey and recreational fleet north of Point Conception in the later half of 
the 1990s. Additional periodic recruitment events are estimated from 1994 
and onward, with the peaks from 2001 and on driven by the PISCO age-0 index.
followed by a period of below average recruitment, and another high recruitment pulse 
in the late 2010s. 


The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:SR_curve2}. The stock has not been depleted to a low enough level that 
would inform the estimation of steepness. Steepness was not estimated in this model, 
and profiles over steepness values are discussed below.

###Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below. 
The full r4ss plotting output is available in the supplementary material.

The fits to the three fishery-dependent and three fishery-independent survey indices 
are shown in Figures \ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_RecDocksideNorth}, 
\ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_DebCPFV}, \ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_RecOnboardNorth},
\ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_PISCO}, \ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_PISCOage0}, and
\ref{fig:index5_logcpuefit_CCFRP}. All indices represent the area 
north of Point Conception only, and not all of these were fit well by the 
assessment model. The MRFSS CPFV recreational dockside survey index north of Point 
Conception spanning the 1980s-1990s was fit well by the model without added variance, 
but relatively flat, and is not a very informative index. The index for 
Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's CPFV onboard observer survey spanning 1988-1998 was well fit 
and indicates an increase in relative abundance in the last year of the survey. 
The current recreational CRFS/Cal Poly onboard observer survey north of Point 
Conception from 2001-2018 was relatively well fit, except for the decline suggested 
2013 and 2014.  The increase in relative abundance observed in 2018 was not fit by the model,
even with the added variance. The variance added to this survey was the highest for all indices.

The model did not capture the contrast in the  PISCO index 
for 15+ cm fish, fitting a decline to the time series from 2010 to 2018, when the index 
suggests an increase from 2010 to 2013 and another increase after a decline in 2016. The 
model does capture the PISCO age-0 index without added variance.  A number of years, e.g., 
2004-2008, were marked by low relative abundance of age-0 GBYR and have larger standard 
errors.  The years with lower relative abundance were not captured by the model, but fit 
to the upper bound of the input standard error.  The increases in age-0 GBYR in 2001, 
2001, 2014-2015 and 2017 were captured in the model fit.

The model was not able to capture the trends observed in the fishery-independent CCFRP 
hook-and-line survey.  The index suggested the same depressed relative abundance in 2013 
as the fishery-dependent CRFS/Cal Poly onboard observer survey, that was also not captured 
here by the fit. The increasing trends in abundance from 2016-2018 was also not captured by 
the model fit, and the fit suggests a declining trend over the entire time series from 2007-2018.

The base model was re-weighted twice using Francis weights for the length and age 
composition data. Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of 
lengths observed by 
year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets. Detailed fits to the 
length data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix 
\ref{appendix-c.-detailed-fits-to-length-composition-data}.  Aggregate fits by fleet 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__aggregated_across_time}. Overall, the 
length composition all fit well. The PISCO fleet has the noisiest of all the length 
composition data, but on an annual basis, the length data were relatively well fit. 
The fit to the aggregated CCFRP data suggests the model expects to see additional 
larger fish, which is likely due to the mirroring of the selectivity.  However, 
on an annual basis, there is a trade-off with the CCFRP with under-fitting of the larger 
fish in the earlier years and an under-fitting of the smaller fish expected in the 
later years (2013-2018).

The mean age of the recreational fleet varied from 1980-1986 ranging from approximately 8-11, 
and increased in 2017 to approximately 13 
(Figure \ref{fig:comp_condAALfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_condAgeRecNorth}). The 
conditional age data from the CCFRP data was not well fit for the earliest years in the 
data, but was reasonably well fit for the last four years of data (Figure \ref{fig:comp_condAALfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_condAgeCCFRP}).  The conditional length 
composition data from the 'dummy' fleet was well fit, although heavily down-weighted.  Age 
data in this fleet are from a number of sources and sampling programs (Figure \ref{fig:comp_condAALfit_data_weighting_TA1.8_condAgeDummy1}).

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Fixing natural mortality at the prior of 0.193
  
  \item Fixing the von Bertalanffy $k$ at the external estimate of 0.247
  
  \item Using the PacFIN expanded length composition data
  
  \item Data weighting scenarios including unweighted, harmonic means (McAllister-Ianelli method), and Francis weights

\end{enumerate}

The following sensitivities are based on the pre-STAR base model and indicate areas that
the STAT identified as either areas of uncertainty or model sensitivities outlined in the 
Accepted Practices and Guidelines document.  A summary of parameters for all sensitivity 
runs is in Table \ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1}.

Fixing either natural mortality or the von Bertalanffy $k$ parameter results in a stock 
with higher spawning output in 2018 as compared to the base model 
(Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity1_spawnbio}).

Fixing either M or k demonstrates the negative correlation between the two parameters. 
The von Bertalanffy $k$ parameter is estimated at 0.12 when natural mortality (estimated 
at 0.21) and growth are both estimated.  When natural mortality is fixed at the prior of 
0.193, $k$ is estimated at 0.14, but the two other growth parameters, L1 and L2 do not change 
much at all.  When $k$ is fixed to the external estimate of 0.247, natural mortality is 
estimated at 0.16, and the other growth parameters both decrease. A number of additional 
sensitivities to the growth parameters will be presented at the STAR panel.

Replacing the CALCOM commercial length composition data with the PacFIN length composition 
results in the stock at an overall lower level of biomass than the base model. Depletion in 
the final year with the PacFIN length composition is 0.50, compared to 0.46 in the base model. 
A detailed discussion on the decision to use the CALCOM length composition in the base model 
can be found in the discussion commercial length and age data, 
Section (\ref{commercial-fishery-length-and-age-data}).

Data weighting is an area of uncertainty for stock assessment, and research is 
ongoing to determine the effects of data weighting and the most appropriate initial 
sample sizes for length and age composition data.  The base model used the Stewart 
sample sizes for initial sample sizes for the fishery data and either the Stewart 
sample sizes or number of "trips" for the survey sample sizes. Weighting the data 
by the harmonic mean resulted in a model with a total likelihood between the base 
model, which uses the Francis method for weighting, and the model with default 
weights (Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity2_spawnbio}). The end year spawning output is 
almost identical for the models using harmonic means and Francis weights, both 
of which down-weighted the composition data.

The Francis weights in the base model were stable, and did not tend to serially 
decrease (down-weight) any of the data sets, which has been seen in other assessments. 
The final base model re-weights the composition data only once. As discussed above 
in the data weighting section, the Dirichlet-Multinomial weighting was explored, but 
a model with a positive definite Hessian was not identified with the pre-STAR 
base model.

-->

###Retrospective Analysis
A 4-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data 
only through 2017 (retro 1), 2016 (retro 2), 2015 (retro 3), and 2014 (retro 4) 
(Table \ref{tab:retro}). 
The initial population size and estimation of trends in spawning biomass in the 
retrospective runs were lower than the base model, except for retro 1 (Figure \ref{fig:retro_spawnb}). 
All retrospective runs followed the same general trend, with the differences in the trends 
stemming from the change in recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:retro_recdev}).  The PISCO age-0 
index has a signal of increased recruitment in the most recent years.  For Retro2, Retro3, and Retro4, 
the trends in recruitment are not observed by the model. There is no conditional age-at-length 
composition data for 2015-2016, leading to the minor change in the age composition likelihood from 
Retro2 to Retro3 and Retro4 (Table \ref{tab:retro}). The age composition data in 
2017 accounts for 2.5% of all available ages, and 4.5% of all fish aged were from 2018. 
The available length data in each year from 2015-2018 range from 4-6% of the total available 
length data.  The length compositions of all the other fleets have similar length 
distributions for 2015-2018 (\ref{appendix-c.-detailed-fits-to-length-composition-data}). 
Additional investigations into the retrospective patters will be made by the STAT.

###Likelihood Profiles
Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and over natural mortality 
values separately with the post-STAR base. These likelihood profiles were conducted by 
fixing the parameter 
at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter 
value (Tables \ref{tab:like_profiles}-\ref{tab:like_profiles2}).

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately 
log($R_0$) of 8.0 (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles} and Figure \ref{fig:profile_R0_like}). 
In terms of likelihood components, only the index data minimize at the upper bound, while 
the other components minimize between 8.0 and 8.1. The individual surveys tend to minimize 
at the upper bound or just below, while the length composition data has conflicting trends, 
e.g., CCFRP and commercial fleets minimize at the upper bound while the recreational north 
fleet minimizes at the lower bound (Figures \ref{fig:profile_R0_piner}-\ref{fig:profile_R0_piner2}). 
The majorityd ata all consistently minimize around 8. Over the range of values of 
$R_0$, depletion ranged from 0.38-0.59 (Figure \ref{fig:profile_R0_depl}).

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood reaches a minimum around a steepness 
near the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:profile_h_like} and 
Table \ref{tab:like_profiles} and Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_depl}). 
The length composition likelihood components declined towards the upper bound for Deb's 
onboard CPFV survey and the recreational north fleet, while the other fleets either 
reached a minimum around 0.55 or at the lower bound  (Figure \ref{fig:profile_h_piner}). 
Overall changes in the survey likelihood across the range of steepens was less than 2.0, 
with surveys either minimized at the lower or upper bound (Figure \ref{fig:profile_h_piner2}).
The relative depletion for GBYR ranges from 0.375 to 0.493 across different assumed values of steepness (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles}).

The negative log-likelihood was minimized at a natural mortality value around 0.21, slightly 
higher than the prior of 0.193 (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles} and Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_like}). 
The age, length, index, and prior likelihood contributions were 
minimized at natural mortality values around 0.22, and the recruitment contribution
was minimized at the upper bound. (Table \ref{tab:like_profiles}). 
The length composition minimizes around a natural mortality value of 0.14, with the commercial, 
recreational fleet north of Point Conception, and CCFRP data minimizing towars the lower 
bound (Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_piner}). The length data from Deb's CPFV survey minimizes 
around 0.22, while the PISCO and recreational length compositions south of Point Conception 
minimize at the upper bound. The PISCO and CCFRP surveys minimized around a natural mortality value 
of 0.22, while the PISCO age-0 and overall survey likelihood minimized at the upper bound of 0.3 
(Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_piner2}). The relative depletion for GBYR ranged from 0.32-0.59 across 
alternative values of natural mortality (Figure \ref{fig:profile_m_depl}).

###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 

The predicted spawning output from the base model shows an initial decline starting the 1950s, 
is then stable, and declines steeply until 1995 (Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}).  The spawning output 
then rapidly increases through the early 2000s, and has been in a decline since 2006. 

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_unfished_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, was below the management target 
from 1981-1998, and below the minimum stock size threshold in 1995.  The stock has been 
above the management target since 1999. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value fixed at 0.72.
