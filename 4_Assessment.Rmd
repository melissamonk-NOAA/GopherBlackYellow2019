##Previous Assessments

###History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock
This is the first full assessment for black-and-yellow rockfish. Black-and-yellow 
rockfish was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using Depletion-Based 
Stock Reduction Analaysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. The DB-SRA model assigned a 
40% probability that the then recent (2008-2009) catch exceeded the 2010 OFL.

Gopher rockfish south of Point Conception was assessed as a data poor species in 2010 
[@Dick2010].  A Depletion-Corrected Average Catch (DCAC) model was used due to time 
constraints. The mean yield? (OFL?) from the DCAC distribution was 25.5.

Gopher rockfish north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude) 
was first assessed a full stock assessment in 2005 [@Key2005] using SS2 (verion 1.19). 
The assessment was sensitive to the CPFV onboard observer index of abundance (referred 
to as Deb Wilson-Vandenber's onboard observer index in this assessment). THe final decision 
table was based around the emphasis given to the index, with a value of 5 given a 40% 
probability and used in the baseline model. The stock was found to be at 97% depletion. 



###2005 Assessment Recommendations

The 2005 STAR panel only had one recommendation specific to gopher rockfish. However, they 
had a number of generic rockfish recommendations that can be found in the STAR panel report 
available [here](https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/by-species/gopher-rockfish/).

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: Additional length and age composition data should be 
  collected for gopher rockfish. This would help to characterize spatial and possibly 
  temporal variation in growth] \hfill \\

   2019 STAT response: Additional age and length data have been collected from a number of 
   sources, the majority of which have been fishery-independent studies, including 
   two master's theses focused on gopher rockfish.  Only a handful of otoliths have been 
   collected for gopher rockfish south of Point Conception.  Additional length composition 
   data are available since the last assessment.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
##Model Description
The mode descriptions in the following sections reflect decisions and modelling 
choices the STAT team made prior to the STAR panel.  Changes from the pre-STAR 
base model to the final post-STAR base model are documented in the "Responses 
to the Current STAR Panel Requests" section.  None of the data changed during 
the STAR panel, and the figures and tables reflect the post-STAR final base model.

###Transition to the Current Stock Assessment
The first formal stock assessment for gophr rockfish was conducted in 2005 [@Key2005]. 
There are two major differences between the 2005 assessment this assessment, 1) 
this assessment models gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish as a complex, and 2) 
this assessment includes the area south of Point Conception.

The 2005 model conducted in SS2 version 1.19 was first transitioned 
to SS3.24z as a bridge model, before moving forward to SS3.30. Below, we describe the 
most important changes made since the last full assessment in 2005 
and explain rationale for each change.  Some of these items are changes due to structure 
changes with Stock Synthesis, and some denote parameters chosen for options that were not
available in SS2 (version 1.19).

Changes in the bridge model from SS2 version 1.9 to SS3.24z and SS3.30.13.08 include:


The way growth is modeled for age-0 fish has changed.  More recent versions of Stock Synthesis 
model length-at-age for fish below the first reference age (Amin) as linearly increasing 
from the initial length bin to the length given by the L_at_Amin parameter. The minimum population 
length bin was reduced from 10 cm in the 2005 assessment to 4 cm in this assessment.  The timing of 
settlement was set at July to reflect the the month at which the young-of-the-year are expected to 
be at 4 cm (Figure \ref{fig:SMURF_lengths}).  The length data leading to this decision were 
provided by Diana Baetscher (UCSC) and were collected via Standard Monitoring Unit for the 
Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) from the UCSC-PISCO kelp forest fish survey as part of her dissertation 
work on GBYR [@Baetscher2019].

This stock assessment retains a single fleet for the commercial fishery, and also 
includes a commercial discard fleet.  Data on commercial discards were not available 
for and not included in the 2005 assessment.  The decision to retain one commercial 
fleet was made by examining the length distributions across species, fishing gears, 
and space, i.e., north and south of Point Conception 
(Figure \ref{fig:Comm_lengths_justification}). There is very little difference between 
the length composition of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish landed in the commercial 
fleet north of Point Conception which contributed 97% of the commercial landings 
from 1978-2018.  The length distributions suggest that gopher rockfish south of 
Point Conception landed dead south of Point Conception dead are slightly smaller 
on average than norht of Point COncpetion.  However, there is not enough data 
available to justify splitting the commercial fishery north and south of Point 
Conception.  The length compositions of discarded fish are small in all for of 
the subplots, suggesting size-based discarding.  Because Stock Synthesis is
not set up to handle depth-dependent discard mortality rates and we're modelling 
two species as a complex with differing depth-dependent discard mortality rates,
the time series of commercial discards was incorporated as a fleet.

This assessment incorporates the area south of Point Conception, which was previously 
excluded from the 2005 assessment.  The length composition data suggested that while 
the lengths of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish were similar, fish encountered 
south of Point Conception were smaller (Figure \ref{fig:Rec_lengths_justification}).
The recreational catches from the man made mode are negligible and did not influence 
the decision to split the fleet at Point Concepetion. The similarity of the length 
distributions between species and among modes within a region were similar and justified 
one recreational fleet.

The 2005 model was a length-based model.  This assessment uses conditional age-at-length from 
fish aged from a number of sources (Table \ref{tab:Age_data}).

Differences in both the recreational and commercial catches used in this assessment are described 
in detail in the \ref{fishery-information} section.

The bias adjustment for recruitment deviations did not exist in SS2 (version 1.19). We set 
1973-2012 as the range of years with full bias adjustment to span the time series 
that was modeled.





###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
There are 12 fleets in the base model.  They include:

*Commercial*: The commercial fleets include two separate fleets, one for GBYR landed 
(all gears combined), and one for commercial dead discards.

*Recreational*: The recreational fleets include two fleets, one for north of Point 
Conception and one for south of Point Conception (all mode combined).

*Fishery-Dependent Surveys*: There are five fishery-dependent survey fleets, one each for 
north and south of Point Conception from the MRFRSS CPFV dockside survey, one each for 
north and south of Point Concpetion from the CDFW/Cal Poly onboard observer survey, and 
one from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard obsever survey that represents north of 
Point Conception only.

*Research*: There are third main sources of fishery-independent data available the CCFRP survey 
the PISCO kelp forest fish survey. A third survey fleey is included as a "dummy" fleet to allow 
incorporation of additional conditional age-at-length composition data from the Zaitlin and 
Abrams theses.  This dummy fleet does not have any length or catches associated with it.


###Other Specifications


###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.13.08 by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.  The r4SS package 
(GitHub release number v1.35.1) was used to post-process output data from Stock
Synthesis. 

###Data Weighting


###Priors
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under “Natural Mortality.” Female 
natural mortality was fixed at the median of the prior, 0.xxx for an assumed
maximum age of xx.  An uninformative prior was used for the male offset natural 
mortality, which was estimated.

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an update for the 
Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), which was endorsed by the Science 
and Statistical Committee in 2018.  The prior is a beta distribution with $mu$=0.xxx and $sigma$=0.xxx.
Steepness is fixed in the base model at the mean of the prior. The priors were applied in sensitivity analyses where these parameters were estimated.



###Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. 

The base model has a total of xxx estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item xxx,
  \item xxx
  \item xxx, and
  \item xxx selectivity parameters
\end{itemize}

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
##Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
incorporates all of the changes made during the STAR panel (see previous section). 
The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic standard errors 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood components are in 
Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.



###Parameter Estimates

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  



(Figure \ref{fig:ts11_Age-0_recruits_(1000s)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals} ). 

The stock-recruit curve ... Figure \ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also 
shown. 

###Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below.  

\ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fits-to-length-composition-data}

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Sensitivity 1
  
  \item Sensitivity 2
  
  \item Sensitivity 3
  
  \item Sensitivity 4
  
  \item Sensitivity 5, etc/
  
  
\end{enumerate}





###Retrospective Analysis



###Likelihood Profiles



###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
