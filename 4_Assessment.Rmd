##Previous Assessments

###History of Modeling Approaches Used for this Stock
This is the first full assessment for black-and-yellow rockfish. Black-and-yellow 
rockfish was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using Depletion-Based 
Stock Reduction Analaysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. The DB-SRA model assigned a 
40% probability that the then recent (2008-2009) catch exceeded the 2010 OFL.

Gopher rockfish south of Point Conception was assessed as a data poor species in 2010 
[@Dick2010].  A Depletion-Corrected Average Catch (DCAC) model was used due to time 
constraints. The mean yield from the DCAC distribution was 25.5 mt.

Gopher rockfish north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude) 
was first assessed a full stock assessment in 2005 [@Key2005] using SS2 (verion 1.19). 
The assessment was sensitive to the CPFV onboard observer index of abundance (referred 
to as Deb Wilson-Vandenber's onboard observer index in this assessment). THe final decision 
table was based around the emphasis given to the index, with a value of 5 given a 40% 
probability and used in the baseline model. The stock was found to be at 97% depletion. 



###2005 Assessment Recommendations

The 2005 STAR panel only had one recommendation specific to gopher rockfish. However, they 
had a number of generic rockfish recommendations that can be found in the STAR panel report 
available [here](https://www.pcouncil.org/groundfish/stock-assessments/by-species/gopher-rockfish/).

\begin{description}[style=unboxed]

  \item[Recommendation 1: Additional length and age composition data should be 
  collected for gopher rockfish. This would help to characterize spatial and possibly 
  temporal variation in growth] \hfill \\

   2019 STAT response: Additional age and length data have been collected from a number of 
   sources, the majority of which have been fishery-independent studies, including 
   two master's theses focused on gopher rockfish.  Only a handful of otoliths have been 
   collected for gopher rockfish south of Point Conception.  Additional length composition 
   data are available since the last assessment.

<!-- ************************MODEL DESCRIPTION***************************** -->
##Model Description
The mode descriptions in the following sections reflect decisions and modelling 
choices the STAT team made prior to the STAR panel.  Changes from the pre-STAR 
base model to the final post-STAR base model are documented in the "Responses 
to the Current STAR Panel Requests" section.  None of the data changed during 
the STAR panel, and the figures and tables reflect the post-STAR final base model.

###Transition to the Current Stock Assessment
The first formal stock assessment for gophr rockfish was conducted in 2005 [@Key2005]. 
There are two major differences between the 2005 assessment this assessment, 1) 
this assessment models gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish as a complex, and 2) 
this assessment includes the area south of Point Conception.

The 2005 model conducted in SS2 version 1.19 was first transitioned 
to SS3.24z as a bridge model, before moving forward to SS3.30. Below, we describe the 
most important changes made since the last full assessment in 2005 
and explain rationale for each change.  Some of these items are changes due to structure 
changes with Stock Synthesis, and some denote parameters chosen for options that were not
available in SS2 (version 1.19).

Changes in the bridge model from SS2 version 1.9 to SS3.24z and SS3.30.13.08 include:


The way growth is modeled for age-0 fish has changed.  More recent versions of Stock Synthesis 
model length-at-age for fish below the first reference age (Amin) as linearly increasing 
from the initial length bin to the length given by the L_at_Amin parameter. The minimum population 
length bin was reduced from 10 cm in the 2005 assessment to 4 cm in this assessment.  The timing of 
settlement was set at July to reflect the the month at which the young-of-the-year are expected to 
be at 4 cm (Figure \ref{fig:SMURF_lengths}).  The length data leading to this decision were 
provided by Diana Baetscher (UCSC) and were collected via Standard Monitoring Unit for the 
Recruitment of Fishes (SMURFs) [@Ammann2004] from the UCSC-PISCO kelp forest fish survey as 
part of her dissertation work on rockfish genetics [@Baetscher2019].

This stock assessment retains a single fleet for the commercial fishery, and also 
includes a commercial discard fleet.  Data on commercial discards were not available 
for and not included in the 2005 assessment.  The decision to retain one commercial 
fleet was made by examining the length distributions across species, fishing gears, 
and space, i.e., north and south of Point Conception 
(Figure \ref{fig:Comm_lengths_justification}). There is very little difference between 
the length composition of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish landed in the commercial 
fleet north of Point Conception which contributed 97% of the commercial landings 
from 1978-2018.  The length distributions suggest that gopher rockfish south of 
Point Conception landed dead south of Point Conception dead are slightly smaller 
on average than norht of Point COncpetion.  However, there is not enough data 
available to justify splitting the commercial fishery north and south of Point 
Conception.  The length compositions of discarded fish are small in all for of 
the subplots, suggesting size-based discarding.  Because Stock Synthesis is
not set up to handle depth-dependent discard mortality rates and we're modelling 
two species as a complex with differing depth-dependent discard mortality rates,
the time series of commercial discards was incorporated as a fleet.

This assessment incorporates the area south of Point Conception, which was previously 
excluded from the 2005 assessment.  The length composition data suggested that while 
the lengths of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish were similar, fish encountered 
south of Point Conception were smaller (Figure \ref{fig:Rec_lengths_justification}).
The recreational catches from the man made mode are negligible and did not influence 
the decision to split the fleet at Point Concepetion. The similarity of the length 
distributions between species and among modes within a region were similar and justified 
one recreational fleet.

The 2005 model was a length-based model.  This assessment uses conditional age-at-length from 
fish aged from a number of sources (Table \ref{tab:Age_data}).

Differences in both the recreational and commercial catches used in this assessment are described 
in detail in the \ref{fishery-information} section.

The bias adjustment for recruitment deviations did not exist in SS2 (version 1.19). We set 
1973-2012 as the range of years with full bias adjustment to span the time series 
that was modeled.

The previous assessment modeled selectivity of the commercial fleet as logistic curve, 
and both parameters for the logistic selectivity were estimated. Selectivity for the 
onboard CPFV survey and recreational fleet were modelled uding the double logistic. The 
current assessment uses the six parameter double normal for all fleets for which selectivity 
is estimated and not mirrored.  The MRFSS dockside CPFV surveys and the CPFV onboard observer 
surveys are mirrored to the recreational fishing fleets, north and south of Point Conception,
respectively.

The 2005 assessment did not include any time blocks.  This assessment includes two time blocks for 
the commercial fleet (1916-1998 and 1999-2018). A 10-inch minimum size limit was placed on the 
commercial fleet in 1999, which was relfected in the CALCOM length composition data. No additional 
time blocks were added for the recreational fleet.  GBYR are a minor component of the nearshore 
rockfish complex and no significant changes were detected in the landings or length composition 
during the time when regulations changed (1999-2002).

The 2005 assessment considered two candidate fishery-dependent indices of abundance, the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer CPFV survey and a dockside intercept survey from MRFSS 
and RecFIN from 1983-2003.  However, the dockside index was removed at the request of the 
STAR panel, citing "did not provide a reliable measure of relative abundance due to changes 
in regulations and fishery targeting during the 1990s-2000s."  The current assessment uses 
a version of the MRFSS database that has been more robustly aggregated to the trip level. 
Starting in 1999, the CDFW begain the onboard observer program (described in the indices of 
abundance). Once the program ramped up by the mid-2000s, almost all of the CPFV groundfish 
trips sampled as onboard observer trips were also sampled as angler intercept surveys, i.e., 
dockside interviews.  Using both the onboard observer data and the dockside interviews for this 
time period would result in developing indices from the same fish.  The onboard observer program 
provides greater detail in terms of catch and location than the dockside sampler examined catch. 
THe onboard observer indices do not include the years 1999 and 2000 due to the number of regulation 
changes occurring in those two years.

The fishery-independent indices are all new for this assessment; the PISCO kelp forest fish 
survey and the CCFRP hook-and-line survey.

Maturity was changed for this assessment based upon newly available data described in the biological 
specifications of this assessment.

The 2005 assessment pre-STAR base model fixed steepness for gopher rockfish at 1.0, which 
was then changed to 0.65 (the Dorn prior at the time) during the STAR panel.
In this assessment, steepness was set at 0.72, the mean of the prior developed 
from a meta-analysis of West Coast groundfish, with a standard deviation of 0.16 (see 
Accepted Practices Guidelines for Groundfish Stock Assessments in the supplemental 
material). 

The prior for female natural mortality was updated to the median of the prior 
from a meta-analysis conducted by Owen Hamel (see Accepted Practices Guidelines for 
Groundfish Stock Assessments in the supplemental material). Assuming a maximum age of 
28 years, the median of the prior is 0.211138, close to the fixed value used in the 
2005 assessment of 0.2.

Due to the fact that the 2005 model only included gopher rockfish and excluded the area 
south of Point Conception, a complete bridge model was not developed.  Comparison of the 2005 
input data, catch streams, and indices are provided throughout the document in appropriate 
sections.

###Summary of Data for Fleets and Areas
There are 12 fleets in the base model.  They include:

*Commercial*: The commercial fleets include two separate fleets, one for GBYR landed 
(all gears combined), and one for commercial dead discards.

*Recreational*: The recreational fleets include two fleets, one for north of Point 
Conception and one for south of Point Conception (all mode combined).

*Fishery-Dependent Surveys*: There are five fishery-dependent survey fleets, one each for 
north and south of Point Conception from the MRFRSS CPFV dockside survey, one each for 
north and south of Point Concpetion from the CDFW/Cal Poly onboard observer survey, and 
one from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard obsever survey that represents north of 
Point Conception only.

*Research*: There are third main sources of fishery-independent data available the CCFRP survey 
the PISCO kelp forest fish survey. A third survey fleey is included as a "dummy" fleet to allow 
incorporation of additional conditional age-at-length composition data from the Zaitlin and 
Abrams theses, the Pearson groundfish cruise, and the special study conducted during the SWFSC's 
juvenile rockfish and ecosystem crusie.  This dummy fleet includes 1,067 ages of gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish. This dummy fleet does not have any length or catches associated with it.


###Other Specifications
Stock synthesis has a broad suite of structural options available.  Where possible, 
the ‘default’ or most commonly used approaches are applied to this stock assessment.
The assessment is a one-sex model, as no significant differnces in growth between 
males and females was detected in external analyses.

The length composition data for some years and fleets was small, and may not be 
representative of the total catch.  Length composition data were removed from the 
model if fewer than 20 fish were measured in a given 
year and fleet. From 1985-1989, two surveys measured fish from the recreational 
party/charter fleet, the Ally et al. [@Ally1991] onboard observer survey and the 
dockside intercept survey. The number of trips and fish sampled by the onboard 
observer survey was far greater than the RecFIN survey and were used in the model. 
Initial input sample sizes were also capped at 400 for each set of length composition 
data.

The time-series of landings begins in 1916 for the commercial fleet and in 1928 for 
the recreational fleet.  This captures the inception of the fishery, so the stock is 
assumed to be in equilibrium at the beginning of the modeled period.
 
The internal population dynamics model tracks ages 0-28, where age 28 is the ‘plus-group.’ 
There are relatively few observations in the age compositions that are greater than age 28. 
The population length bins and the length composition length bins are set at 1-cm bins from 
fish 4-40 cm.

The extra standard deviation parameter was added to all indices except the 
Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV onboard observer index and the MRFSS dockside index 
for north of Point Conception that both had relatively large estimated variances 
associated with them.  The extra parameter was explored, but estimated to be on 
the lower bound, and was removed for the final base model. All other indices, 
both recent recreational onboard obsever indices, CCFRP, PISCO, and the MRFSS 
dockside index south of Point Conception, were estimated with relatively small 
variances (10-20%) from their respective indices.  Extra variance was estiamted 
for these indices in the base model.

The following likelihood components are included in this model: catch, indices, discards, 
length compositions, age compositions, recruitments, parameter priors, and parameter soft 
bounds. See the SS technical documentation for details [@Methot2019].

Electronic SS model files including the data, control, starter, and forecast files can be 
found on the 
[PFMC ftp site](ftp://ftp.pcouncil.org/pub/!2019%20GF%20STAR%20Panels/STAR%20Panel%204%20-%20Cowcod-Gopher/).



###Modeling Software
The STAT team used Stock Synthesis 3 version 3.30.13.08 by Dr. Richard Methot at 
the NWFSC. This most recent version was used, since it included 
improvements and corrections to older versions.  The r4SS package 
(GitHub release number v1.35.1) was used to post-process output data from Stock
Synthesis. 

###Data Weighting
Length composition and conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions sample sizes for 
the base model were tuned by the "Francis method," based on equation TA1.8 in Francis 
[-@Francis2011], and implemented in the r4ss package. This approach involves comparing 
the residuals in the model’s expected mean length with respect to the observed mean 
length and associated uncertainty derived from the composition vectors and their 
associated input sample sizes. The sample sizes are then tuned so that the observed 
and expected variability are consistent. After adjustment to the sample sizes, models 
were not re-tuned if the bootstrap uncertainty value around the tuning factor overlapped 1.0.

As outlined in the Best Practices, a sensitivity run was conducted with length and 
conditional-age-at-length (CAAL) compositions were re-weighted using the 
Ianelli-McAllister harmonic mean method [@McAllister1997]. Additionally, weighting 
using the Dirichelet-Multinomial likelihood, that includes and estimable parameter (theta) 
that scales the input sample size, was explored. However, the model did not converge when 
the Dirichelet-Multinomial likelihood was applied to a number of of the fleets with composition 
data. Given this, and the current challenges with this method described in the Stock Synthesis 
manual [@Methot2019], the Francis weightings were applied in the base model.

A series of sensitivities were conducted to determine the need to estimate 
extra variability parameters were estimated and added to the survey CPUE indices, and 
described below in the Estimated Parameters section. 


###Priors
The log-normal prior for female natural mortality were based on a meta-analysis 
completed by Hamel [-@Hamel2015], as described under “Natural Mortality.” Natural mortality 
was estimated using with a prior of, 0.211 for an assumed maximum age of 28.  

The prior for steepness (*h*) assumes a beta distribution with parameters based on an 
update for the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (Dorn, M. and Thorson, J., pers. comm.), 
which was endorsed by the Science and Statistical Committee in 2019.  The prior is a 
beta distribution with $mu$=0.72 and $sigma$=0.16. Steepness is fixed in the base model 
at the mean of the prior. 


###Estimated and Fixed Parameters
A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Tables 
\ref{tab:model_params}. Time-invariant, growth is estimated in 
this assessment, with all SS growth parameters being estimated. The log of the 
unexploited recruitment level for the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function is 
treated as an estimated parameter. Annual recruitment deviations are estimated 
beginning in 1978.  The survey catchability parameters are calculated analytically (set as 
scaling factors) such that the estimate is median unbiased, which is comparable to 
the way q is treated in most groundfish assessments.   

The base model has a total of 111 estimated parameters in the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Natural mortality
  \item Equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$) and 71 recruitment deviations
  \item Stock recruitment autocorrelation parameter
  \item Five growth parameters
  \item Five index extra standard deviation parameter, and
  \item 27 selectivity parameters
\end{itemize}

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and parameters is provided in Table \ref{tab:model_params}.

_Growth._Five growth parameters were estiamted for the one-sex model: three von 
Bertalanffy parameters and two parameters for CV as a function of length-at-age 
related to variability in length-at-age for small and large fish.

_Natural Mortality._ The estimated natural mortality of 0.217647 is close to the 
mean of the prior, 0.1928571.

_Selectivity._  Selectivity for all fleets was estimated as double-normal. 

Selectivity was estimated as asymptotic for the commercial fleet, with one 
time block.  Asymptotic selectivity was also estimated for both recreational 
fleets, Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer survey, and the PISCO.  Three 
parameters were estimated for each of these fleets, the peak, the ascending 
width, and the selectivity at the first bin.

Dome-shaped selectivity was estimated for the commercial discard fleet and the CCFRP 
survey.  Five of the size parameters were estimated for the commercial discard 
selectivity (selectivity at the last bin was fixed).  Four parameters were estimated 
for the CCFRP length compositions (selectivity at the first and last bins was fixed)


_Other Estimated Parameters._ Recruitment deviations for the base model are estimated 
from 1978 to 2018.  The base model also included estimated recruitment deviations for 
the forecast years, although these have no impact on the model estimates for the current year.

Many variations of the base case model were explored during this analysis. Sensitivities 
to asymptotic vs. domed selectivity were explored for the appropriate fisheries, e.g. 
commercial fisheries and surveys, as well as estimating selectivity and mirroring fleet 
selectivities. Time blocked selectivity without the time block from 1999-2019 for the 
recreational fisheries was investigated.  

Much time was also spent tuning the advanced recruitment bias adjustment options.  
Sensitivities were performed to each of the thirteen 
advanced options for recruitment, e.g., early recruitment deviation start year, 
early recruitment deviation phase, years with bias adjustments, and maximum bias 
adjustment.  The final base model sets the first year of recruitment deviations just 
prior to when the majority of fishery/survey length composition are available.

Initial runs showed that the estimated recruitments were highly auto-correlated.  
Therefore, an auto-correlation parameter was late estimated and its value was 
estimated to be positive and significantly different from zero.

Several models were also investigated where steepness and natural mortality were 
either estimated, fixed at their respective priors.   


Xi, Anything else to add to this section??


_Other Fixed Parameters._ The stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the SSC approved 
steepness prior for rockfish of 0.72.  


##Model Selection and Evaluation
###Key Assumptions and Structural Choices
Key assumptions in the model are that it is appropriate to model gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfish as a complex.  The catch histories are inseparable at this time, especially for 
the commercial landings. The biological information available also precluded complete analyses 
of difference in in growth, i.e., the majority of black-and-yellow rockfish aged were small 
fish and small fish were lacking for gopher rockfish.  Data from both species were used to 
provide a complete picture of the growth curve.

The assessment is a one area model with fleets as areas for the recreational fishery.  There 
were only a handful of aged gopher rockfish from south of Point Conception, and not enough 
other biological information available that would have justified a multi-area model.



###Alternate Models Considered

A number of models were run with different catch histories for the recreational fleet 
south of Point Conception, given that the catch histories were modified from the original 
data.  None of the alternatives explored altered the model at any significant level 
due to the fact that the recreational catches south of Point Conception are relatively 
small. Results from select sensitivity runs compared to the base model are in Table 
\ref{tab:Sensitivity_model1}.

Two sensitivites were also performed altering the commercial discard catch history.  The 
discard catch was set to zero for all years prior to 2004, the year when WCGOP estimates 
were first availble, and to a constant rate of 17% of the commercial landings, the maximum 
discard rate observed in the WCGOP data.  Neither of these sensitivities resulted in any 
significant change to the model ouputs.

Sensitivities of the model to the spawning and settlement months were also explored.
The base model originally set settlement month to January. Both gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish settle at a small size (~2 cm) and over a course of several 
months. After exploring the young-of-the-year length data made available by 
Diana Baetscher, the timing of settlement was moved to July for the base model, 
when the majority of GBYR are 4 cm, the size of the smallest length bin.  The change of 
the timing of settlement had little effect on the model results.

Runs of the base case model estimating steepness were also considered.

A sensitivity of the model to using the commercial length composition data from PacFIN was 
also considered.  The fits to the changed only slightly, (increasing depletion from 0.46 
to 0.48) but given the concerns outlined in the discussion on commercial lenght composition 
the base model includes the commercial length compositions from CALCOM.

Sensitivities were developed to look at alternate selectivity patterns for the the commercial 
discard fleet and the CCFRP survey.  Neihter of the lenght compositiosn for these fleets 
observed larger fish.  A time block for the commercial discard fishery was not considered 
since no length composition of discarded fish were available prior to 2004.

Xi, any others to add here?


###Convergence
Model convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed 
values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better 
minimum. Jitter is a SS option that generates random starting values from a normal 
distribution logistically transformed into each parameter’s range [@Methot2019]. This 
was repeated 240 times and the minimum was reached in xx% of the runs  (Table \ref{tab:jitter}).
The model did not experience convergence issues, e.g., final gradient was below 0.0001,
when reasonable starting values were used and there were no difficulties in inverting 
the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability.  We did sensitivity runs for 
convergence by changing the phases for key estimated parameters; neither the total 
log-likelihood nor the parameter estimates changed.

<!-- *********************MODEL 1 RESULTS********************************** -->
##Base Case Model Results 
The following description of the model results reflects a base model that 
was developed prior to the STAR panel (this section will be updated after the 
STAR panel). The base model parameter estimates and their approximate asymptotic 
standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:model_params} and the likelihood 
components are in Table \ref{tab:like_components}.  Estimates of derived reference points and 
approximate 95% asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1}.
Time-series of estimated stock size over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:Timeseries_mod1}.

Steepness of the assumed Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship was fixed at 0.72, and
natural mortality was estimated to be 0.22.

###Parameter Estimates
The base model produces estimates of growth parameters different from the external 
estimates.  The external estimate of the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient $k$ 
was 0.2488, whereas the internal estiamte was much lower at 0.125. Using the Schnute 
parameterization with the age for L1 set at 2 and L2 at 23, the external estimates of lengths 
at Amin and Amax were 11.8 and 28.28, respectively.  The internal estimates of the lengths 
for Amin and Amax were 9.67 and 28.35, respectively. Natural mortality was estimated 
in the base model and natural mortality and the growth parameter k are negatively 
correlated, and the model sensitivity to growth and natural mortality are explored in
the sensitivities.  


The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model.  

Selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets.  The estimated 
selectivities for all fleets within the model are shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:sel01_multiple_fleets_length1}. The commercial fishery selectivities are 
all asymptotic.  Maximum selectivity for the commercial fleet is reached at 34 cm 
from 1916-1998 and also selected fish smaller than recent years.  The implementation 
of the 10-in size limit resulted in a steeper selectivity curve, with fish fully 
selected at 31 cm from 1999-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:sel03_len_timevary_surf_flt1sex1}). 

The commercial discard fleet did not observe any fish over 36 cm in the 14 years of 
available data. The majority of the nearshore fishery for GBYR is the live fish fishery, 
and fishermen are fishing shallower waters in order to ensure that the landed fish 
remain alive. The larger GBYR likely reside in waters deeper than typically fished 
by this fleet.

The recreational fleet north of Point Conception selects the largest fish of the other 
fleets, with full selectivity at 34 cm. Fish south of Point Conception encountered 
in the recreational fleet were noticeably smaller, and fully selected at 29 cm. 

The two fishery-independent surveys sample differen habitats and dpeth ranges. 
The PISCO study only samples in 0-20 m dpeth and observers small young-of-the-year 
fish and adults, but not the 10-17 cm size range.  The asmyptotic selecticity for 
the PISCO survey does not go to zero on the ascending side since the young-of-the-year 
fish are observed.  The CCFRP survey does not see the largest size classes, possibly 
due to the shallowed maximum depth fished to reduce barotrauma.  Dome shaped 
selectivity was estimated for this survey. 

The additional survey variability (process error added directly to each year's input 
variability) for all surveys was estimated within the model. The model estimated a 
small added variance for MRFSS dockside recreational index north of Point Conception 
that was then turned off for the final base model.  The added variance for Deb's onboard 
observer survey was esimated at 
Deb's onboard observer survey
`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_DebCPFV(5)", 3], 6)` 
but the model presented stability issues during jittering when the variabilility 
was turned off.  Therefore, it was turned on for the final base model, and 
can be explored further. The added variances were highest 
for the recreational onboard observer survey north of Point Conception
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecOnboardNorth(6)", 3], 3)`)
and south of Point conception 
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecOnboardSouth(7)", 3], 3)`),
the MRFSS dockside south of Point Conception
(`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_RecDocksideSouth(11)", 3], 3)`),
PISCO (`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_PISCO(8)", 3], 3)`), and 
CCFRP (`r round(mod1$parameters[mod1$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CCFRP(9)", 3], 3)`).

Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1978-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:recdevs2_withbars}). 
Estimates of recruitment suggest that GBYR are characterized by cyclical years of high 
and low recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:Recruit_mod1}). The years of highest estimated 
recruitment were in the early 1990s, forllowed by a period of below average 
recuitment, and another high recruitment pulse in the late 2010s. The PISCO kelp forest 
fish survey is the only fishery-indepedent survey taht observed young-of-the-year GBYR 
in this assessment.

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a fixed value of steepness is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:SR_curve2} with estimated recruitments also shown. The stock is predicted to 
have never fallen to low enough levels that the steepness is obvious. Steepness was 
not estimated in this model, but sensitivities to estimating steepness when growth was 
fixed to an exernal estimate is discussed below.

###Fits to the Data
Model fits to the indices of abundance, fishery length composition, survey length 
composition, and conditional age-at-length observations are all discussed below. 
The full r4ss plotting output is available in the supplementary material.

The fits to the five fishery-dependent and two fishery-independent survey indices 
are shown in Figures \ref{fig:index1_logcpuefit_RecDocksideNorth} - 
\ref{fig:index1_logcpuefit_CCFRP}. The majority of the indices represent the area 
north of Point Conception only and not all of these were fit well by the 
assessment model. The MRFSS recreational dockside survey index north of Point 
Conception spanning the 1980s-1990s was fit well by the model without added variance, 
but relatively flat, and is not a very informative index. The index for Deb's CPFV 
onboard observer survey spanning 1988-1998 was well fit and indicates an increase 
in relative abundance in the last year of the survey.  The current recreational CPFV 
onboard observer survey north of Point Conception from 2001-2018 was relatively well 
fit, except for the decline suggested 2013 and 2014.  The increase in relative abundance 
observed in 2018 was not fit by the model, even with the added variance.

The fishery-dependent indices for south of south of Point Conception 
were both relatively flat.  The MRFSS CPFV dockside survey index was relatively well 
fit and indicated an increase in the last two years of the survey, 1998-1999.  The 
current onboard observer survey representing 2001-2018 showed very little trend in 
the estimted CPUE, and the variance added to this survey was the highest for all indices. 

The fishery-independent PISCO kelp forest fish survey index indicates a cyclical trend that 
was not captured by the model fit. The fit to the index is realtively flat This may be in 
part due to the observation of both young-of-the-year, small juveniles, and adults in the 
survey.  An alternative index of abundance teasing apart the two life stages will be 
developed and presented at the STAR panel. 

The model was not able to capture the trends observer in the fishery-independent CCFRP 
hook-and-line survey.  The index suggested the same depressed relative abundance in 2013 
as the fishery-dependent onboard observer survey, that was also not captured here by the fit. 
The increasing trends in abudance from 2016-2018 was also not captured by the model fit, and 
the fit suggests a declining trend over the entire time series from 2007-2018.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the proportions of lengths observed by 
year and the Pearson residuals-at-length for all fleets.  Detailed fits to the 
length data by year and fleet are provided in Appendix 
\ref{appendix-a.-detailed-fits-to-length-composition-data}.  Aggregate fits by fleet 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:comp_lenfit__aggregated_across_time}. Overall, the 
length composition all fit well. The fit to the the commercial discard length composition 
was underestimated at the peak, but otherwise captures the observations well.  The same is 
true for one of the peaks at 25 cm for the PISCO data, that were the noisest of all the length 
composition data.  There are a handful of years within some of the annual length composition 
data that were not particularly well fit, e.g., 1980 and 1996 for RecSouth, but these were usually 
due to high frequencies of fish in a small number of length bins.

###Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Sensitivity 1
  
  \item Sensitivity 2
  
  \item Sensitivity 3
  
  \item Sensitivity 4
  
  \item Sensitivity 5, etc/
  
  
\end{enumerate}





###Retrospective Analysis



###Likelihood Profiles



###Reference Points
Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution 
among fleets in the most recent year of the model, (`r LastYR - 1`). Sustainable total 
yield (landings plus discards) were `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate and with a 95% confidence interval of `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,3]` mt 
based on estimates of uncertainty. The spawning biomass equivalent to 40% of the unfished 
level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r Ref_pts_mod1[7,2]` mt. 


(Figure \ref{fig:ts7_Spawning_biomass_(mt)_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}

The `r LastYR` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass 
is above/below the target of 40% of unfished 
levels (Figure \ref{fig:ts9_Spawning_depletion_with_95_asymptotic_intervals_intervals}). 
The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, has been xxx the management target 
for the entire time series of the model. 

Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base 
model and Figure \ref{fig:yield1_yield_curve} shows the equilibrium curve based on a 
steepness value xxx.
