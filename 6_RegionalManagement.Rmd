#Regional Management Considerations
While the proportion of the stock residing within U.S. waters is unknown, 
the assessment provides an adequate geographic representation of the portion 
assessed for management purposes.  There is little evidence that black-and-yellow 
rockfish extend into Mexico, and the proportion of gopher rockfish residing 
south of Pt. Conception is small. While there has been work on the genetic structure 
between the two species, there has not been work done within each species to inform spatial 
structure of the populations. Given the relatively small 
area in the waters of California where these species occur, there is relatively little
concern regarding exploitation in proportion to the regional distribution of abundance 
in the area assessed in this study.

The state of California implements regional management for the recreational fleet in 
the form of five regions, referred to as management areas with differing depth and season 
restrictions.  Neither gopher nor black-and-yellow rockfish are a large 
componenet of the total recreational landings and are managed as part of the  
nearshore rockfish complex.  Current regional management appears appropriate for these 
species.
