#Regional Management Considerations
While the proportion of the stock residing within U.S. waters is unknown, 
the assessment provides an adequate geographic representation of the portion 
assessed for management purposes.  There is little evidence that black-and-yellow 
rockfish extend into Mexico, and the proportion of gopher rockfish residing 
south of Pt. Conception is small. while there has been work on the genetic structure 
of the two species, there has not been work done within species to inform whether 
or not there is genetic spatial structure to the population. Given the relatively small area in the waters of California where these species occur, there is relatively little
concern regarding exploitation in proportion to the regional distribution of abundance in the area assessed in this study.

The state of California implements regional management for the recreational fleet in 
the form of five regions.  Neither gopher nor black-and-yellow rockfish are a large 
componenet of the total recreational landings and are managed as part of a shallow 
nearshore rockfish complex.  Current regional management appears appropriate for these 
species.
