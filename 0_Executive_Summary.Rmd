#Executive Summary{-}

##Stock{-}
This assessment reports the status of the gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish  
complex (GBYR, \emph{`r spp.sci`}) resource in U.S. waters off the coast of 
California south of Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude) 
using data through `r LastYR`. Both gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes are 
most abundant north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude)
and are uncommon north of Point Arena ($38^\circ 57^\prime$ N. latitude). The range 
of gopher rockfish extends into Baja California, but the black-and-yellow rockfish 
are rare south of Point Conception.


##Catches{-}
Information on historical landings of `r spp` are available back to 1916
(Table \ref{tab:Exec_catch}). The recreational fleet began ramping up in the 1950s 
and has fluctuated over the the last 50 years (Figure \ref{fig:Exec_catch1}).  The majority 
of GBYR recreational landings have been from north of Point Conception throughtout the time 
period modelled. 

Commercial landings were small during 
the years of World War II, ranging between `r min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1939 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 1945,2],0))` to `r max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] >= 1939 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= 1945,2],0))` metric 
tons (mt) per year (Figure \ref{fig:Exec_catch2}). Commercial landings 
increased after World War II and show periods of cyclical catch for gopher and black-and-yellow 
rockfishes. The commercial live fish fishery began in the early 1990s, with the first reported 
live landings in 1993.  Since then the commercial catch has been dominated by the live fish fishery, 
with minimal landings of dead gopher or black-and-yellow rockfishes.  Estimates of total mortality of 
commercial discards were available starting in 2004, and were estimated prior to then. The catches 
aggregated by fleets modeled in this assessment can be found in Figure \ref{fig:r4ss_catches}.

Since 2000, annual total landings of catch and discards of `r spp` have ranged between 
`r paste0( min(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] > 2000 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= Dat_end_mod1,2],0)), '-', max(round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] > 2000 & Tot.catch.df[,1] <= Dat_end_mod1,2],0)) )` mt, with landings (catch + discards) in `r Dat_end_mod1` totaling `r round(Tot.catch.df[Tot.catch.df[,1] == Dat_end_mod1,2],0)` mt.

##Data and Assessment{-}

Gopher rockfish north of Point Conception ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. latitude) 
was first assessed as a full stock assessment in 2005 [@Key2005] using SS2 (version 1.19). 
The assessment was sensitive to the recreational party boat onboard observer index of relative 
abundance (referred to as Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard observer index in this assessment). 
The final decision table was based around the emphasis given to this index of relative abundance. 
The stock was found to be at 97% depletion in 2005. 

Gopher rockfish south of Point Conception was assessed as a data poor species in 2010 
[@Dick2010].  A Depletion-Corrected Average Catch (DCAC) model was used due to time 
constraints. The mean yield from the DCAC distribution was 25.5 mt.

This is the first full assessment to include data for black-and-yellow rockfish. 
Black-and-yellow rockfish was assessed coastwide as a data poor species using 
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) [@Dick2010]. The DB-SRA 
model assigned a 40% probability that the then recent (2008-2009) catch 
exceeded the 2010 OFL.

This assessment of the GBYR complex covers the area from Cape Mendocino to the U.S./Mexico border 
(Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}). The length composition data suggested that while 
the lengths of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish were similar, fish encountered 
south of Point Conception were smaller. The similarity of the length 
distributions between species and among modes within a region were similar and justified 
one combined recreational fleet within each of the two regions (north and south of Point 
Conception).

This stock assessment retains a single fleet for the commercial fishery, including discards. 
Data on commercial discards were not available 
for and not included in the 2005 assessment.  The decision to retain one commercial 
fleet was made by examining the length distributions across species, fishing gears, 
and space, i.e., north and south of Point Conception. There is very little difference between 
the length composition of gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish landed in the commercial 
fleet north and south of Point Conception.

A number of sources of uncertainty are addressed in this assessment. This 
assessment includes length data, estimated growth, an updated length-weight curve, an
updated maturity curve, a number of new indices, and new conditional age-at-length data.

##Stock Biomass{-}
The predicted spawning output from the base model generally showed a slight decline prior 
to 1978, when the recruitment deviations are first estimated (Figure \ref{fig:Spawnbio_all} 
and Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}). The stock declined from 1978 to 1994, 
followed by a period of increase from 1995 to 2003. From 2004-2018 the stock has been 
in decline, though increased in total biomass since 2016 and exhibits stable spawning 
output since from 2018 to 2019. The 2019 estimated spawning output relative to unfished 
equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output at 43.82 
(95% asymptotic interval: 33.57-54.06) (Figure \ref{fig:RelDeplete_all}). 
Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty 
in the estimated spawning output is moderately high, (95% asymptotic interval: 337-767 million eggs).

##Recruitment{-}
Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1979-2018 (Figure \ref{fig:Recruits_all} and 
Table \ref{tab:Recruit_mod1}).  There are estimates of very strong recruitment in 1991, 
with high recruitment pulses for a number of other years including 1994-1995

##Exploitation status{-}
Harvest rates estimated by the base model indicate catch levels have been below the 
limits that would be associated with the Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) = 50% limit 
(corresponding to a relative fishing intensity of 100%) (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and 
Figure \ref{fig:SPR_all}). SPR is calculated as the lifetime spawning potential per 
recruit at a given fishing level relative to the lifetime spawning potential per recruit 
with no fishing. The relative inverse SPR increased over the last decade from a low period 
from 2004-2008, ranged from 0.64 to 0.77 from 2009-2015, and ranged from 0.80 to 0.82 from 
2016-2018 (Table \ref{tab:SPR_Exploit_mod1} and Figure \ref{fig:SPR_phase}).

##Ecosystem Considerations{-}
In this assessment, ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in the analysis.  
This is primarily due to a lack of relevant data and results of analyses (conducted elsewhere) 
that could contribute ecosystem-related quantitative information for the assessment.

Both gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish are a prey species for a number of predatory groundfish 
species that are also have active fisheries, including lingcod and cabezon. These predators are thought 
to contribute to significant post-settlement mortality for both species [@Johnson2006; @Johnson2007]. 
Additional studies, both ecosystem modelling and on predator diets, woudl help elucidate the effects of 
predation on the GBYR complex.



##Reference Points{-}

This stock assessment estimates that `r spp` in the `r mod1_label` is 
`r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MT>0,"above","below")` the biomass 
target ($SB_{40\%}$), and well `r ifelse(Deplete_mod1[nrow(Deplete_mod1),2]-MSST>0,"above","below")` 
the minimum stock size threshold ($SB_{25\%}$). 
The estimated relative depletion level for the base model in 2018 is 
43.82 (95% asymptotic interval:33.57-54.06, corresponding 
to `r paste(Spawn_mod1, fecund_unit,sep=' ')` 
(95% asymptotic interval: `r paste(Spawn_mod1_CI, fecund_unit, sep=' ')`) of 
spawning output in the base model (Table \ref{tab:SpawningDeplete_mod1}).  Unfished 
age `r min_age` biomass was estimated to be `r Ref_pts_mod1[2,2]` mt in the 
base case model. The target spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) 
is `r paste(Ref_pts_mod1[7,2], fecund_unit,sep=' ')`, which corresponds with an 
equilibrium yield of `r Ref_pts_mod1[10,2]` mt. Equilibrium yield at the proxy $F_{MSY}$ 
harvest rate corresponding to $SPR_{50\%}$ is `r Ref_pts_mod1[15,2]` mt (Table \ref{tab:Ref_pts_mod1} 
and Figure \ref{fig:Yield_all}).

##Management Performance{-}

Gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes are managed as part of the minor nearshore 
complex in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. The total mortality 
of the minor nearshore rockfish has been below the ACL in all years (2011-2016). 
Total mortality estimates from the NWFSC are not yet available 
for 2017-2018. GBYR total mortality was on average 20% of the total minor nearshore 
rockfish total mortality from 2011-2016. A summary of these values 
as well as other base case summary results can be found in Table \ref{tab:mnmgt_perform}.

##Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties{-}
The major source of uncertainty identified during the STAR panel are the 
structure of two species complex, the contribution of each of the two species to the complex, 
and differences in biological parameters between the species.  There is currently no 
information for either species on regional differences in biological parameters
and contributions to the complex.

\FloatBarrier




##Decision Table{-}    

The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the post-STAR 
base model, with the forecasted projections of the OFL presented in 
Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set to 
the projected catch from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) of 114 mt.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon 
at the STAR panel, reflecting three different growth assumptions/estimates.  The external 
estimate of growth was different than the internal Stock Synthesis estimate. Given that 
natural mortality rate $M$ is fixed in the post-STAR base model, and the growth parameter 
$k$ is negatively correlated with $M$, $k$ was chosen as the axis 
of uncertainty. The high state of nature fixes $k$ at the external estimate, and for the 
low state of nature, $k$ is fixed at 0.046, the same distance in log space from the base 
as the high state of nature. For the low state of nature, parameters L1 and L2 
were estimated at 14.1 and 30.6, respectively.  The high state of nature fixed all 
growth parameters, $k$ = 0.248, L1 = 13.8, and L2 = 28.5 to the external 
estimate of growth (due to improbable estimates of L1 and L2 if only $k$ was fixed to the 
external estimate). The growth parameters in the base model were estimated as 
$k$ = 0.107, L1 = 13.4, and L2 = 28.8.

For reference, the model predicted sigma is 0.189 and the decision table-based sigma is 0.197. 
The forecasted buffer ramp was calculated assuming a category 2 stock, with  sigma = 1.0 
and a $p^*$ = 0.45. The buffer multiplier ranges from 0.874 in 2021 ramping to 0.803 in 2030. 
Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature project that 
the stock will remain above the target 
threshold of 40% for all but two scenarios (Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1}).  The 
low state of nature with the high catches results in a stock at 
26.4% of unfished in 2030 and the base state model with the 
high catches results in a stock at 34.0% of unfished in 2030.  The base 
model with the base catches results in an increasing stock over the period from 
2021-2030. If the growth of GBYR is slower than the base model suggests, but the 
base model catches are removed, the stock will be at the target threshold in 2030.

##Research and Data Needs{-}
We recommend the following research be conducted before the next assessment:


\begin{enumerate}

\item Investigate the structure of complex and contribution of each species to the 
GBYR complex. Investigate possible spatial differences in biological parameters within 
a single species and also between the two species.  Little biological data for south of 
Point Conception or north of Point Arena were available for this assessment and is needed 
to better under biological parameters. 
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Conduct life history studies
     \item conduct research to identify the proportion of each species in population and in catches
    \end{enumerate}

\item Take a closer look at the Ralston (Ralston et al. 2010) historical catch reconstruction 
for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfishes.  The recreational catch reconstruction for 
gopher rockfish south of Point Conception was an order of magnitude higher than expected 
when extracted for this assessment.  

\item Refine the PISCO survey data and analysis to better identify age-0 fish in each 
month of survey.  Occasional sampling during all months of the year would better help 
identify the length distribution of fish classified as age-0. This is the only recruitment 
index available for gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish. If possible, age data should be 
collected from the PISCO survey to aid in determining the growth of young gopher and 
black-and-yellow rockfish, and larger black-and-yellow rockfish.

\item Refine CCFRP survey index to look at alternative possible model structures, including 
a hierarchical structure and random effects.  Limited time did not allow for these 
explorations during this assessment cycle.  It is also strongly recommended to continue 
the coastwide sampling of the CCFRP program that began in 2017, as well as the collection 
of biological samples for nearshore rockfish species.  The CCFRP survey is the only 
fishery-independent survey available for nearshore rockfish sampling the nearshore rocky 
reef habitats. As of this assessment, only two years of coastwide data are available, 
and the index was limited to the site in central California that have been monitored 
since 2007.

\item Collection of length and age data are recommended for both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries.  Very little age data are available from either fishery for 
gopher rockfish and none for black-and-yellow rockfish.

\item Data collection and coordination across Research Recommendations 1-5 is needed to improve 
the efficacy of data collection and ensure that samples are representative of the 
data sources and the fisheries.  For example, the conditional age-at-length data in 
the dummy fleet represent a number of sampling techniques, areas sampled, and 
selectivities.  Better coordination of research efforts will allow the age data 
to be better utilized by the assessment.  Sampling of the commercial and recreational 
fleets by area in proportion to the length distribution of fish observed will also 
allow the model to better fit selectivity patterns and avoid possible patterns in the 
length and age composition residuals.

\item Investigate possible environmental drivers/co-variates for biological parameters, 
particularly for recruitment.

\item Examine the CFRS angler interview data for the recreational private/rental mode 
to create a "trip" based identifier or catch and effort. This will enable the creation 
of an index of abundance for the private/rental mode as well as investigate if 
selectivity for this mode differs from the party/charter mode.

\item Resolve differences between CalCOM and PacFIN expanded length composition data sets. 


\end{enumerate}
