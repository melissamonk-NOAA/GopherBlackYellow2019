#Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
The forecasts of stock abundance and yield were developed using the post-STAR 
base model, with the forecasted projections of the OFL presented in 
Table \ref{tab:OFL_projection}. The total catches in 2019 and 2020 are set to 
the projected catch from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) of 114 mt.

Uncertainty in the forecasts is based upon the three states of nature agreed upon 
at the STAR panel and are based three states of nature of growth.  The external 
estimate of growth was different than the internal Stock Synthesis estimate. Given that 
natural mortality is fixed in the post-STAR base model, and the growth parameter 
$k$ is negatively correlated with natural mortality, $k$ was chosen as the axis 
of uncertainty. The high state of nature fixes $k$ at the external estimate, and the 
low state of nature is the same distance in log space from the base as the high state 
of nature. The low state of nature fixed $k$ at 0.046 and the L1 and L2 parameters 
were estimated at 14.1 and 30.6, respectively.  The high state of nature fixed all 
growth parameters, $k$ = 0.248, L1 = 13.8, and L2 = 28.5 to the external 
estimate of growth (due to improbable estimates of L1 and L2 if only $k$ was fixed to the 
external estimate). The growth parameters in the base model were estimated as 
$k$ = 0.107, L1 = 13.4, and L2 = 28.8.

The forecasted buffer ramp was calculated assuming a category 2 stock, with  sigma = 1.0 
and a $p^*$ = 0.45. The buffer fraction ranges from 0.874 in 2021 ramping to 0.803 in 2030.  For 
reference, the model predicted sigma is 0.189 and the decision table-based sigma is 0.197.
Current medium-term forecasts based on the alternative states of nature project that 
the stock will remain above the target 
threshold of 40% for all but two scenarios (Table \ref{tab:Decision_table_mod1}).  The 
low state of nature with the high catches results in a stock at 
26.4% of unfished in 2030 and the base state model with the 
high catches results in a stock at 34.0% of unfished in 2030.  The base case 
model with the base catches results in an increasing stock over the period from 2021-2030. 
If the growth of GBYR is slower than the base model suggests, but the base case catches are 
removed, the stock will be at the target threshold in 2030.
