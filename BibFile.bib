abstract = {I evaluated a standard monitoring unit for the recruitment of reef fishes (SMURF) as a tool for ascertaining spatial and temporal patterns of reef fish recruitment in central California, USA. SMURFs consisted of a 1.0 x 0.35 m dia. cylinder of fine mesh plastic grid that contained a folded section of larger mesh plastic grid. SMURFs collected new recruits of 20 species of fish with 92% of the individuals collected from 10 species, mostly rockfish (genus Sebastes). An experiment varying depth of SMURFs in the water column (surface, mid-depth, or bottom) showed that surface SMURFs collected the greatest diversity of species and significantly greater abundance for eight species, with two species having significantly greater abundance on mid-depth SMURFs and three species having significantly greater abundance on bottom SMURFs. A comparison of cumulated recruitment from SMURFs that varied in sampling frequency (removal of new recruits every 1-3, 7, or 28 days) suggested that increasing the time between sampling caused a significant decrease in recruitment estimates for some species but not for others. To determine how well temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs reflected patterns to nearby reefs, I compared within season temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs with that at nearby reefs, estimated by visual transect surveys conducted on scuba. Temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs were significantly and positively related to early recruitment on reefs for one group of benthic-algal associated rockfish species when diver surveys were lagged by 30 days (r=0.87) and for another group of canopy-algal associated rockfish species when lagged by 5 days (r=0.72). SMURFs appeared to be an effective and efficient method for indexing relative rates of delivery of competent juveniles for many temperate nearshore reef fishes.},

abstract = {Islands of high genomic divergence that contain genes of evolutionary significance may form between diverging species. The gopher rockfish, Sebastes carnatus, and black-and-yellow rockfish, S. chrysomelas, are sympatrically distributed temperate marine species inhabiting rocky reefs and kelp forests on the west coast of the United States. Prior studies documented low levels of genetic divergence between the two species, except at a single microsatellite locus that displayed high divergence, Sra.7-2. To better characterize genome wide divergence, we scored 25 additional microsatellite loci. Mean neutral divergence between species (F(ST) = 0.01) changed little from prior estimates. Sra.7-2 continued to be an extreme divergence outlier. Five novel microsatellites within Â± 15 kb of Sra.7-2 were characterized. High divergence, consistently low diversity in S. chrysomelas, and linkage disequilibrium were detected at these loci, suggesting the influence of recent selection. However, coalescent modelling of divergence at neutral and Sra.7-2 regions showed that initial divergence at Sra.7-2 was ancient, likely predating divergence at neutral regions. It is therefore unlikely that Sra.7-2 divergence represents solely recent ecological divergence within one species and may represent the action of recurrent selection. Introgressive gene flow (2N(E) m) was much higher (>1) at neutral than Sra.7-2 regions (<1) despite evidence that two S. carnatus individuals have recently mixed ancestry at the Sra.7-2 region. The Sra.7-2 genomic region is likely one of several regions containing genes involved in initiating and maintaining species integrity. Completion of the final stages of speciation appears to be a slow and ongoing process for these species.},

Most species listed in the Pacific Coast\nGroundfish Fishery Management Plan have not been assessed, in large part due to data limitations.\nEstimates of sustainable yield for many these species were previously based on undocumented, ad-hoc\nanalyses. We present estimates of sustainable yield for 50 of these stocks using two recently developed\nmodels designed to inform management of data-poor stocks. These models rely on recently\nreconstructed time series of historical catch for west-coast groundfish species and species-specific\ninformation related to stock productivity. For this set of data-poor stocks, recent landings statistics\nreflect shifts in the relative importance of certain species to west-coast fisheries (e.g. increased catches\nof nearshore and slope rockfish species relative to shelf species), largely due to recent regulatory\nactions. We provide estimates of overfishing limits (OFLs) for each of the 50 stocks along with\ncomparisons to recent catch levels. Our results suggest that status quo harvest levels range from light\nexploitation of some stocks to potential overfishing of others. This information could help inform\ndecisions regarding prioritization of future stock assessments for unassessed species. OFLs are\nexpressed as probability distributions, reflecting our uncertainty in model parameters.

abstract = {Abstract By providing new approaches to the investigation of demographic and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations, molecular genetics has led to fundamental changes in our understanding of marine ecology. In particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries?induced evolution affecting life?history traits. (iii) A compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective population sizes that are 2?6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the resilience to environmental change ? a key consideration for sustainable fisheries management.},

abstract = {Density dependence in demographic rates can strongly affect the dynamics of populations. However, the mechanisms generating density dependence (e.g., predation) are also dynamic processes and may be influenced by local conditions. Understanding the manner in which local habitat features affect the occurrence and/or strength of density dependence will increase our understanding of population dynamics in heterogeneous environments. In this study I conducted two separate field experiments to investigate how local predator density and habitat complexity affect the occurrence and form of density-dependent mortality of juvenile rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). I also used yearly censuses of rockfish populations on nearshore reefs throughout central California to evaluate mortality of juvenile rockfish at large spatial scales. Manipulations of predators (juvenile bocaccio, S. paucispinus) and prey (kelp, gopher, and black-and-yellow [KGB] rockfish, Sebastes spp.) demonstrated that increasing the density of predators altered their functional response and thus altered patterns of density dependence in mortality of their prey. At low densities of predators, the number of prey consumed per predator was a decelerating function, and mortality of prey was inversely density dependent. However, at high densities of predators, the number of prey killed per predator became an accelerating response, and prey mortality was directly density dependent. Results of field experiments and large-scale surveys both indicated that the strength of density-dependent mortality may also be affected by the structural complexity of the habitat. In small-scale field experiments, increased habitat complexity increased the strength of density-dependent mortality. However, at large scales, increasing complexity resulted in a decrease in the strength of density dependence. I suggest that these differences resulted from scale-dependent changes in the predatory response that generated mortality. Whether increased habitat complexity leads to an increase or a decrease in the strength of density-dependent mortality may depend on how specific predatory responses (e.g., functional or aggregative) are altered by habitat complexity. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that rates of demographic density dependence and the resulting dynamics of local populations may largely depend upon attributes of the local habitat.},

abstract = {For species that have an open population structure, local population size may be strongly influenced by a combination of propagule supply and post-settlement survival. While it is widely recognized that supply of larvae (or recruits) is variable and that variable recruitment may affect the relative contribution of pre- and post-settlement factors, less effort has been made to quantify how variation in the strength of post-settlement mortality (particularly density-dependent mortality) will affect the importance of processes that determine population size. In this study, I examined the effects of habitat complexity on mortality of blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus) within nearshore reefs off central California. I first tested whether variation in habitat complexity (measured as three-dimensional complexity of rocky substrate) affected the magnitude of both density-independent and density-dependent mortality. I then used limitation analysis to quantify how variation in habitat complexity alters the relative influence of recruitment, density-independent mortality, and density dependent mortality in determining local population size. Increased habitat complexity was associated with a reduction in both density-independent and density-dependent mortality. At low levels of habitat complexity, limitation analysis revealed that mortality was strong and recruitment had relatively little influence on population size. However, as habitat complexity increased, recruitment became more important. At the highest levels of habitat complexity, limitation by recruitment was substantial, although density-dependent mortality was ultimately the largest constraint on population size. In high complexity habitats, population dynamics may strongly reflect variation in recruitment even though fluctuations may be dampened by density-dependent mortality. By affecting both density-independent and density-dependent mortality, variation in habitat complexity may result in qualitative changes in the dynamics of populations. These findings suggest that the relative importance of pre- vs. post-settlement factors may be determined by quantifiable habitat features, rather than ambient recruitment level alone. Because the magnitude of recruitment fluctuations can affect species coexistence and the persistence of populations, habitat-driven changes in population dynamics may have important consequences for both community structure and population viability.},

We developed an index of relative abundance from fish spotter data based on extended delta-lognormal models and applied the method to data for northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). In contrast with previous approaches, our method used all available data, provided an index for northern anchovy that was proportional to abundance, and explicitly modeled factors (pilots, regions, seasons, and time of day) that affected observations by fish spotters. We also included information about mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature in models for a reduced study area and found that envi- ronmental data, where available, can be used to improve estimates of relative abundance from fish spotter data. Simulation results indicated that our approach is a cost-effective way to improve biomass estimates for pelagic species like northern anchovy},

The depletion-corrected average catch (DCAC) formula is an extension of the potential-yield formula, and it provides useful estimates of sustainable yield for data-poor fisheries on long-lived species. Over an extended period (e.g. a decade or more), the catch is divided into a sustainable yield component and an unsustainable "windfall" component associated with a one-time reduction in stock biomass. The size of the windfall is expressed as being equivalent to a number of years of sustainable production, in the form of a "windfall ratio". The DCAC is calculated as the sum of catches divided by the sum of the number of years in the catch series and this windfall ratio. Input information includes the sum of catches and associated number of years, the relative reduction in biomass during that period, the natural mortality rate (M, which should be <0.2 year-1), and the assumed ratio of FMSY to M. These input values are expected to be approximate, and based on the estimates of their imprecision, the uncertainty can be integrated by Monte Carlo exploration of DCAC values.},

abstract = {A Bayesian approach to fisheries stock assessment is desirable because it yields a probability density function (pdf) of population model parameters. This pdf can help to provide advice to fishery managers about the consequences of alternative harvest policies and convey uncertainty about quantities of interest such as population biomass. In stock assessment, catch-age data are commonly used to estimate population parameters. However, there are few catch-age analyses that use Bayesian methods. In this paper, we extend the sampling - importance resampling algorithm so that a pdf of population model parameters can be estimated using catch-age data and indices of relative abundance. We illustrate the procedure by estimating a 54-parameter pdf for yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea. The example demonstrates how catch-age data can markedly improve Bayesian estimation, and also illustrates the potential for significant biases in treating trawl survey abundance indices as absolute measures of stock size.},

abstract = {The genus Sebastes contains over 110 species, an unusually high level of species diversity for marine fishes. Many of the 70 species that occupy the northeast Pacific Ocean coexist during parts or all of their life cycle. Although allopatric speciation explains much of this diversity, the presence of many closely related species within the same locations suggests that other isolating mechanisms may play a role. Sebastes carnatus and Sebastes chrysomelas are a sympatrically distributed pair of sister species having no morphologically distinguishing characteristics other than color: S. carnatus has pinkish spots on a brown background, and S. chrysomelas has yellow spots on a black background. In this study, seven nuclear microsatellite DNA loci were employed to assess relatedness of 111 S. carnatus and 91 S. chrysomelas sampled from three locations spanning the species' range. Analysis of the seven microsatellite loci provided evidence of genetic divergence between color morphs (F-ST = 0.046, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, magnitude of genetic divergence between the color morphs was consistent among geographic locations. Divergence between S. carnatus and S. chrysomelas was low relative to that detected among other species within the genus, suggesting that the two morphs; represent reproductively isolated incipient species.},

abstract = {An initial step in catch and effort analysis is determination of what subset of the data is relevant to the analysis. We propose an objective approach to subsetting trip records of catch and effort data when fishing locations are unknown; the species composition taken on a fishing trip is used to infer if that trip's fishing effort occurred in a habitat where the species of interest (the target species) is likely to occur. We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records. We test this approach by applying it to a data set where individual fishing locations are known, and we show that the method is an effective substitute for information on individual fishing locations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Waples2006,
abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high ( approximately 100%; P < 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H(0): Nm < X) can also be high, provided that true Nm < or = 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm < or = 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

abstract = {Molecular genetic data have found widespread application in the identification of population and conservation units for aquatic species. However, integration of genetic information into actual management has been slow, and explicit and quantitative inclusion of genetic data into fisheries models is rare. In part, this reflects the inherent difficulty in using genetic markers to draw inferences about demographic independence, which is generally the information of the greatest short-term interest to fishery managers. However, practical management constraints, institutional structures and communication issues have also contributed to the lack of integration. This paper identifies some of the organizational, conceptual and technical barriers that have hampered full use of genetics data in stock assessment and hence fishery management and outlines how such use could be enhanced.},
