abstract = {Islands of high genomic divergence that contain genes of evolutionary significance may form between diverging species. The gopher rockfish, Sebastes carnatus, and black-and-yellow rockfish, S. chrysomelas, are sympatrically distributed temperate marine species inhabiting rocky reefs and kelp forests on the west coast of the United States. Prior studies documented low levels of genetic divergence between the two species, except at a single microsatellite locus that displayed high divergence, Sra.7-2. To better characterize genome wide divergence, we scored 25 additional microsatellite loci. Mean neutral divergence between species (F(ST) = 0.01) changed little from prior estimates. Sra.7-2 continued to be an extreme divergence outlier. Five novel microsatellites within ± 15 kb of Sra.7-2 were characterized. High divergence, consistently low diversity in S. chrysomelas, and linkage disequilibrium were detected at these loci, suggesting the influence of recent selection. However, coalescent modelling of divergence at neutral and Sra.7-2 regions showed that initial divergence at Sra.7-2 was ancient, likely predating divergence at neutral regions. It is therefore unlikely that Sra.7-2 divergence represents solely recent ecological divergence within one species and may represent the action of recurrent selection. Introgressive gene flow (2N(E) m) was much higher ({\textgreater}{\textgreater}1) at neutral than Sra.7-2 regions ({\textless}{\textless}1) despite evidence that two S. carnatus individuals have recently mixed ancestry at the Sra.7-2 region. The Sra.7-2 genomic region is likely one of several regions containing genes involved in initiating and maintaining species integrity. Completion of the final stages of speciation appears to be a slow and ongoing process for these species.},

abstract = {The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires$\backslash$nRegional Fishery Management Councils to set annual catch limits for all stocks or stock complexes in$\backslash$nFederal fishery management plans beginning in 2011. Most species listed in the Pacific Coast$\backslash$nGroundfish Fishery Management Plan have not been assessed, in large part due to data limitations.$\backslash$nEstimates of sustainable yield for many these species were previously based on undocumented, ad-hoc$\backslash$nanalyses. We present estimates of sustainable yield for 50 of these stocks using two recently developed$\backslash$nmodels designed to inform management of data-poor stocks. These models rely on recently$\backslash$nreconstructed time series of historical catch for west-coast groundfish species and species-specific$\backslash$ninformation related to stock productivity. For this set of data-poor stocks, recent landings statistics$\backslash$nreflect shifts in the relative importance of certain species to west-coast fisheries (e.g. increased catches$\backslash$nof nearshore and slope rockfish species relative to shelf species), largely due to recent regulatory$\backslash$nactions. We provide estimates of overfishing limits (OFLs) for each of the 50 stocks along with$\backslash$ncomparisons to recent catch levels. Our results suggest that status quo harvest levels range from light$\backslash$nexploitation of some stocks to potential overfishing of others. This information could help inform$\backslash$ndecisions regarding prioritization of future stock assessments for unassessed species. OFLs are$\backslash$nexpressed as probability distributions, reflecting our uncertainty in model parameters. We select median$\backslash$nvalues as point estimates of OFL, as this statistic is most consistent with National Standard 1 guidelines.},
